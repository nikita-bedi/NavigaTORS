abstractPURPOSE Deﬁnitive or postoperative chemoradiation (CRT) is curative for human papillomavirus –associated
(HPV1) oropharynx cancer (OPC) but induces signi ﬁcant toxicity. As a deintensi ﬁcation strategy, we studied
primary transoral surgery (TOS) and reduced postoperative radiation therapy (RT) in intermediate-riskHPV1OPC.
METHODS E3311 is a phase II randomized trial of reduced- or standard-dose postoperative RT for resected stage
III-IVa (American Joint Committee on Cancer-seventh edition) HPV 1OPC, determined by pathologic pa-
rameters. Primary goals were feasibility of prospective multi-institutional study of TOS for HPV 1OPC, and
oncologic ef ﬁcacy (2-year progression-free survival) of TOS and adjuvant therapy in intermediate-risk patients
after resection. TOS plus 50 Gy was considered promising if the lower limit of the exact 90% binomial con ﬁdence
intervals exceeded 85%. Quality of life and swallowing were measured by functional assessment of cancertherapy-head and neck and MD Anderson Dysphagia Index.
RESULTS Credentialed surgeons performed TOS for 495 patients. Eligible and treated patients were assigned as
follows: arm A (low risk, n 538) enrolled 11%, intermediate risk arms B (50 Gy, n 5100) or C (60 Gy, n 5108)
randomly allocated 58%, and arm D (high risk, n 5113) enrolled 31%. With a median 35.2-month follow-up for
359 evaluable (eligible and treated) patients, 2-year progression-free survival Kaplan-Meier estimate is 96.9%
(90% CI, 91.9 to 100) for arm A (observation), 94.9% (90% CI, 91.3 to 98.6]) for arm B (50 Gy), 96.0% (90% CI,92.8 to 99.3) for arm C (60 Gy), and 90.7% (90% CI, 86.2 to 95.4) for arm D (66 Gy plus weekly cisplatin).Treatment arm distribution and oncologic outcome for ineligible or step 2 untreated patients (n 5136) mirrored
the 359 evaluable patients. Exploratory comparison of functional assessment of cancer therapy-head and necktotal scores between arms B and C is presented.
CONCLUSION Primary TOS and reduced postoperative RT result in outstanding oncologic outcome and favorable
functional outcomes in intermediate-risk HPV 1OPC.

INTRODUCTION
Approximately 15,000 cases of human papillomavirus –
associated (HPV 1) oropharynx cancer (OPC) are di-
agnosed annually in the United States and have superiorcure rates to tobacco- and alcohol-associated OPC.
1-3
HPV1OPC commonly presents with a small primary
tumor and cervical lymphadenopathy amenable tosurgical treatment.
4,5Transoral robotic surgery (TORS)
or transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) may address thismalignancy in a minimally invasive manner
6and,
when combined with risk-adjusted postoperativeradiation therapy (PORT), may achieve comparable cure
rates. Retrospective reports suggest improved functional
results with primary transoral surgery (TOS),7,8yet its role
in multidisciplinary man agement and treatment dein-
tensi ﬁcation remains uncertain.9
Treatment with either surgery and adjuvant therapy10,11
or with de ﬁnitive chemoradiation (CRT) achieves high
rates of cure for HPV 1OPC.2However, as patients are
likely to live longer and experience the associated long-term toxicity of de ﬁnitive CRT,
12there is interest in
radiation and/or chemotherapy deintensi ﬁcation forASSOCIATED

 those patients with excellent prognosis. Both surgical and
nonsurgical deintensi ﬁcation strategies are actively being
pursued in numerous clinical trials.13,14TOS with de-
escalated postoperative management is one potential
deintensi ﬁcation strategy.7,10Retrospective studies of TOS
compared with de ﬁnitive CRT show high oncologic ef ﬁcacy,
and suggest improved functional results in patients un-dergoing surgery with decreased gastrostomy tubedependency.
7,8,15At the time this study was designed,
sufﬁcient normative data for design of a phase III trial
comparing TOS and deintensi ﬁed postoperative therapy
were not available, and thus, Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) and the American College of Radiology
Imaging Network (ACRIN) Cancer Research GroupE3311 was conducted as a randomized phase II trial ofprimary TOS, with adjuvant therapy based on pathologicrisk assessment, for HPV 1OPC. Our primary objectives
were to demonstrate the feasibility of a prospective multi-institutional study of TOS for HPV 1OPC followed by
risk-adjusted adjuvant therapy, and to assess the onco-
logic ef ﬁcacy, re ﬂected in 2-year progression-free survival
(PFS), of transoral resection and adjuvant therapy inpatients determined to be at intermediate risk after surgicalexcision.
Study Design and Participants
E3311 ( NCT01898494 ) is a randomized phase II study of
transoral surgery (TOS) followed as indicated by postoper-
ative radiation therapy (PORT) with or without chemother-
apy for stage III-IVA human papillomavirus 1oropharynx
cancer (OPC; using American Joint Committee on Cancer-seventh edition). Patients de ﬁned as having intermediate
risk were randomly allocated to reduced (50 Gy)- or stan-dard (60 Gy)-dose radiation. Eligible patients had T1-2p161squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx ame-
nable to transoral resection, with no matted nodes, and werecandidates for radiation and cisplatin. The study Protocol
(online only) and eligibility criteria have been previouslydescribed in greater detail.
16The institutional review board
(IRB) at each site approved the study Protocol, which was
approved by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) central IRB.
All study subjects provided written informed consent andwere enrolled on step 1 (TOS). Step 2 adjuvant treatmentarm assignment was determined by pathologic risk pa-rameters (Appendix Table A1 , online only), as follows: low-
risk patients de ﬁned T1-T2 resected with negative ( .3m m )
margins, N0-N1 and no extranodal extension (ENE), wereobserved (arm A); intermediate-risk patients de ﬁned T1-T2
resected to negative or close ( ,3 mm) margins, N1-N2
with#1 mm ENE, or up to four positive nodes were randomly
a l l o c a t e dt o5 0G y( a r mB )o r6 0G y( a r mC )o fP O R T ;h i g h e r -risk patients (arm D) were those with positive margins,.1 mm of ENE, and/or $5 metastatic lymph nodes, and
received 66 Gy of PORT with concurrent weekly cisplatin at40 mg/m
2. The random assignment in the intermediate-risk
patient group was strati ﬁed by smoking history ( #10v.10
pack-years). Validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO)
measuring quality of life and swallowing were collected.
Statistical Analysis
The study was designed to estimate the 2-year PFS rate for
intermediate-risk patients who received TOS followed byreduced-dose PORT (arms B and C). The regimen of TOSplus reduced-dose radiation (arm B and C, analyzedseparately) would be considered worthy of further study if,
for the given arm, the upper limit of the exact 90% binomial
CI exceeded 85%, indicating a result consistent withnoninferiority to the outcomes observed in our prior studyE2399. It was expected that 48% of the patient populationwould be evaluable intermediate risk, and therefore asample size of 377 was targeted to enroll at least 180intermediate-risk patients.CONTEXT
Key Objective
Our primary objectives were to demonstrate the feasibility of a prospective multi-institutional study of transoral surgery (TOS)
for human papillomavirus 1oropharynx cancer followed by risk-adjusted adjuvant therapy, and to assess the 2-year
progression-free survival of TOS and reduced adjuvant therapy in intermediate-risk patients.
Knowledge GeneratedThis novel randomized phase II clinical trial reports the ﬁrst prospective multicenter data for TOS in head and neck cancer.
For the 70% of patients who underwent deintensi ﬁed postoperative adjuvant therapy, outstanding progression-free
survival supports the safety and ef ﬁcacy of treatment deintensi ﬁcation (elimination of chemotherapy, and 10 Gy less
radiation). Exploratory comparison suggests a trend toward better quality-of-life scores associated with reduced radiation
therapy and chemotherapy.
RelevancePrimary TOS and reduced postoperative radiation therapy result in outstanding oncologic outcome and favorable functional
outcomes in intermediate-risk human papillomavirus 1oropharynx cancer.

 RESULTS
Of 120 applications, 87 surgeons at 59 sites were
credentialed,17and 68 accrued at least one patient. We
separately reported details regarding surgical quality as-surance including positive margin rate, postoperative gradeIII or IV oropharyngeal bleeding, and number of nodesremoved.
17One noncredentialed surgeon accrued three
patients (see Fig 1 CONSORT diagram). The surgeon
underwent a retrospective credentialing procedure,according to ECOG ACRIN and institutional review board
guidance, and was found to qualify. After ligation of cervical
vessels was made a strong recommendation in a trialamendment (activated January 13, 2016), the only grade Vfatal oropharyngeal bleeding occurred (out of 256 enrolledpatients after amendment activation) with the omission ofrecommended vessel ligation. No difference in grade III-Voral bleeding events was observed before and afteramendment mandating ligation (6.1% v6.1%; P5.99).Assigned or randomly allocated to an arm

 From December 2013 to July 2017, 68 credentialed sur-
geons enrolled 519 patients and performed TOS for 495
patients with HPV 1OPC. Among the 495 patients who

 Among patients who underwent TORS, 11% were assigned
to arm A, 28% and 30% randomly allocated to arms B and
C, respectively, and 31% were assigned to arm D. Amongpatients who underwent TLM, 11% were assigned to arm A,
32% and 24% were randomly allocated to arms B and C,
respectively, and 34% were assigned to arm D. Eighty-one
patients (71 of whom were eventually treated) were
deemed ineligible; 48 patients were ineligible for step 1(surgery) and 33 patients were ineligible for step 2. The
most common reasons for ineligibility at step 1 included
prestudy scans and/or laboratory tests completed before
the 4-week preregistration window (n 527) and presence
of clinical T3 disease at baseline (n 54). Ineligibility at step
2 was predominantly because of registration to step 2
at.7 weeks after surgery (n 518) and incorrect risk
assignment (n 514) after central review. Although we
report evaluable patients (n 5359) for the primary end
point and demographics of this group as shown in Table 1 ,
we also present data for all ineligible or untreated (on step
2) patients who underwent planned surgery (n 5136), as
well as ineligible and step 2 treated patients (n 571),
because ineligibility determinations were made during data
cleaning, only including those patients who had received
accurate treatment arm assignments to, and been treated
on, step 2 of the study (Appendix Table A2 , online only).
The proportion of patients assigned to each arm in step 2
was comparable between the total and treated populationand the eligible and treated population: 11% to arm A
(N549); 57% to arms B (N 5120) and C (N 5127); and
31% to arm D (N 5134). We continued follow-up of in-
eligible or misclassi ﬁed patients (n 571) for safety
reporting and outcome.
Patient demographics are shown in Table 1 for those
evaluable (n 5359), who were analyzed for the primary
end point ( Fig 1 , CONSORT diagram), as well as in Ap-
pendix Table A3 (online only) for ineligible or step 2 un-
treated patients who received TOS (n 5136). The median
age was 58 years (range of 37-80 years), and the majority
were male (88.9%), with primary disease site of tonsil
(66.3%), and #10 pack-years of smoking history (70.2%).
Among the 359 evaluable, arm A (N 538) enrolled 11%,
arms B (50 Gy, N 5100) or C (60 Gy, N 5108) randomly
allocated 58%, and arm D (N 5113) enrolled 31%. Arm D
assignment was based on .1 mm extranodal extension
(ENE; 77%), .4 nodes (27%), and/or positive margins
(11%). ENE of any extent was present in 37% of patients on
E3311. ENE #
1 mm comprised 34% of the patients with
any ENE, with the other 66% scored .1 mm and leading to
arm D assignment. Indeed, 77% of arm D patients hadENE.1 mm, and some patients had multiple arm D risk
factors. The positive margin rate was 3.3% overall. Forty-sixpatients received (and were eligible for) TOS (step 1) andassigned to adjuvant therapy (step 2) but subsequently didnot start treatment or deemed ineligible for step 2 (17% inarm A [N 58]; 59% in arms B [N 514] and C [N 513];
and 24% in arm D [N 511]).
In September 2015, the data safety monitoring com-
mittee reviewed the interim analyses results regardingaccrual, risk distribution, and surgical quality. The ob-
served accrual rate was 18.5 patients per month, higher
than the assumed eight patients per month. Among theﬁrst 59 patients completing transoral resection, 29 were
intermediate risk. Among the ﬁrst 59 eligible patients,
ﬁve grade 3 bleeding events and two cases with positive
margins were reported. Thus, the prespeci ﬁed stopping
rules were not met. The ﬁnal composite quality assur-
ance end point was a 9.1% rate of combined grade III or
IV oropharyngeal bleeding or positive margins (4.0%
positive margins, 5.9% grade III or IV oropharyngealbleeding, 6.1% grade III-V oropharyngeal bleeding).
Among the 359 evaluable patients, current median follow-
up time among patients who did not progress is
35.2 months, and it is 35.0 months among evaluableintermediate-risk patients who did not progress. Among the
21 recurrences observed at the time of this analysis, 10
were local-regional and 11 were distant ( Table 2 ).Figure 2
displays PFS curves for all evaluable patients, by arm. The
2-year PFS Kaplan-Meier estimate was 96.9% (90% CI,
91.9 to 100) for arm A, 94.9% (90% CI, 91.3 to 98.6) forarm B, 96.0% (90% CI, 92.8 to 99.3) for arm C, and 90.7%
(90% CI, 86.2 to 95.4) for arm D. The 3-year PFS estimates
were 96.9% (90% CI, 91.9 to 100) for arm A, 94.9% (90%CI, 91.3 to 98.6) for arm B, 93.4% (90% CI, 89.2 to 97.8)
for arm C, and 90.7% (90% CI, 86.2 to 95.4) for arm D. The
single patient with the unexpected ﬁnding of N3 disease
without other high-risk features, who was assigned to armC, experienced a local late recurrence at 30 months;
sensitivity analyses excluding this patient showed results
consistent with the primary analysis (2-year PFS of 95.9%;90% CI, 92.7 to 99.3). Exploratory comparisons of PFS
between the arms (using the log-rank test) revealed no
signi ﬁcant differences ( Pvalues50.90 for B vC; 0.30 for B
vD; 0.30 for C vD), although caution should be taken in the
interpretation of these results as the study was not powered
for the direct comparison of arms B and C, and differencesin both treatment and risk confound the comparisons ofarms B or C and D.
Those with smoking history ( .10v#10 pack-years) did
not have a detectably worse 3-year PFS in arms B or C
(97%; 90% CI, 92.2 to 100 v93.9%; 90% CI, 89.1 to 98.9
in arm B; 95.2%; 90% CI, 87.9 to 100 v92.8%; 90% CI,

 Fifteen percent (n 574) of patients on step 1 experienced
grade 3 treatment-related toxicities, 2% (n 510) experi-
enced grade 4 treatment-related toxicities, and ,1%
(n51) patient experienced grade 5 treatment-related
toxicities. The most common grade 3 toxicities were dys-phagia (6%, n 531) and oral hemorrhage (3%, n 513).
Appendix Table A6 (online only) summarizes treatment-
related toxicities for step 2. Grade 3, 4, and 5 treatment-related toxicity rates were 13%, 2%, and 0% on arm B,24%, 0%, and 0% on arm C, and 49%, 11%, and 1% onarm D, respectively. The most common grade 3 toxicitieswere oral mucositis (5% in arm B, 11% in arm C, and 19%in arm D) and dysphagia (3% in arm B, 5% in arm C, and16% in arm D). There were four treatment-related deaths
(one surgical and three on arm D). Signi ﬁcantly different
grade III-V toxicity rates were observed between patients onarm B and arm C (14%, 17 of 120 v24%, 31 of 127,
Pvalue5.030), arms B and D (14%, 17 of 120 v60%, 81
of 134, Pvalue,.0001), and arms C and D (24%, 31 of
127 v60%, 81 of 134, Pvalue,.0001).
We measured patient-reported outcome (PRO) for quality
of life (QOL; functional assessment of cancer therapy-head
and neck [FACT-HN]) and swallowing (MD AndersonDysphagia Index [MDADI]) in arms A-D ( Figs 4A and 4B;
Appendix Tables A7 and A8, online only), with 70%
compliance at 6-month post-treatment for FACT-HN. Al-though consistent decline in QOL and swallowing scoreswas observed during treatment, these recovered to baselinein arms A-C with slightly lower scores after adjuvant therapyin arm D. Comparing change in FACT-HN total score from
baseline to 6-month post-treatment, between arms B or Cagainst D, 56% of patients in arms B or C had a stable orimproved score compared with 38% of patients in arm D(Pvalue5.009, using a one-sided Fisher ’s exact test). An
exploratory comparison between arms B and C revealed a
marginally signi ﬁcant difference (63% in arm B and 49% in
arm C had a stable or improved score, Pvalue5.066).
However, these results should be interpreted with cautionas the study design was not powered for a comparisonbetween the randomized arms, and differences in bothtreatment and risk confound the comparison of arms B or Cversus D. With an intent-to-treat analysis of all step 2 treatedpatients, the FACT-HN score differences remain numeri-
cally stable; however, the comparisons gain statistical
signi ﬁcance (at 6 months, 57% of patients in arms B or C
had stable or improved FACT-HN scores v39% of arm D,
P5.005; 65% of patients in arm B had stable or improved
FACT-HN scores v50% in arm C, P5.033.) Additional
PROs and analyses of functional swallowing using objectivemeasurements (eg, modi ﬁed barium swallow) studies will

 prospectively.4The ECON-ACRIN (E3311) Trial was designed
to collect normative information regarding feasibility andsurgical quality in a multi-inst itutional trial, treatment arm
assignment, and PFS of redu ced-dose (50 Gy) or standard-
dose (60 Gy) radiation therapy (RT) without chemotherapy.We also collected correlative PROs for QOL and swallowingfunction using MDADI and FACT-HN, as well as functional,
modi ﬁed barium swallow studies at de ﬁned time points for
comparison between arms.
Deintensi ﬁcation approaches for HPV 1OPC have gener-
ally focused on modifying nonsurgical treatment, such as
reduced RT or chemotherapy. RTOG 1016 demonstrated
that cisplatin chemotherapy was superior to cetuximabwhen added to standard-dose, de ﬁnitive RT (70 Gy),
conﬁrmed in the DeESCALATE trial.
20,21The NRG HN-002
trial14suggested inferior oncologic outcomes for patientstreated nonsurgically with reduced-dose RT (60 Gy) and
without chemotherapy for favorable-risk HPV 1OPC. Single-
or multi-institutional case series suggest that primary TOS
is feasible and safe.22-26However, lack of intent-to-treat
analyses and heterogeneous postoperative management
directed by inconsistent, locally de ﬁned criteria complicate
interpretation of these studies. Indeed, level I data for using
primary TOS and prespeci ﬁed criteria to deintensify ad-
juvant therapy for good prognosis of HPV 1OPC have been
lacking. The ECON-ACRIN (E3311) Trial now demon-strates the safety, feasibility, and high oncologic ef ﬁcacy in
a large multicenter cooperative group trial. Use of primaryTOS and 50 Gy PORT for HPV 1OPC with multiple positive
nodes or #1 mm ENE (up to half of those with pathologic
ENE) would provide 70% of patients with a deintensi ﬁed
therapeutic option after transoral resection.Time PointMean Score

 Historically, PORT dose prescription has been guided by
pathologic risk assessment dictating the RT dose, with manyseminal studies
27-29occurring before transoral surgical ap-
proaches. These older studies typically provided RT dosesapproximating 60 Gy to the surgical bed but pathologicallynegative or positive but with in termediate pathologic risk
features. Where pathologic risk features associated with a
higher risk of relapse such as ENE or multiple pathologic riskfactors, a dose of 63 Gy in 1.8 Gy per fraction was recom-mended. In E3311, we adopted a similar approach tointermediate-risk pathologic features with our standard doseof 60 Gy to sites of pathology but did not require pathologicallynegative regions to be irradiated to 60 Gy, and allowedtreatment to 50 Gy at the discretion of the treating radiation
oncologist. The primary invasive tumor site was prescribed for
irradiation to 60 Gy in arm C. By contrast, arm B treated thedissected primary and neck to 50 Gy. Our ﬁndings suggest
that both approaches are associated with a high 2-year PFS.
We designed this trial to generate normative data regarding
TOS and the feasibility of reduced postoperative radiationdose. Our ﬁnding of 95% 2-year PFS among intermediate-
risk patients who received 50 Gy PORT is among the bestresults yet described for this population, comparing fa-vorably to comparable-stage patients managed with de-ﬁnitive chemoradiation,
20to favorable risk nonsmokers
treated with de ﬁnitive chemoradiation,14and favorable-risk
nonsmokers treated with postoperative docetaxel andreduced-dose radiation.
30An expanding literature regard-
ing the activity of lower-dose radiation in HPV 1OPC in both
the de ﬁnitive and postoperative setting supports our con-
clusion that TOS and 50 Gy PORT is oncologically ap-propriate in intermediate-risk patients. Although medianfollow-up was over 35 months for the primary end point of
2-year PFS, the natural history of recurrence after de ﬁnitive
treatment of HPV 1OPC may require longer follow-up,
particularly for distant metastatic disease, in addition todetecting differences in late toxicity.
31Continued observation of
this valuable study population will provide the ﬁrst large, multi-
institutional cohort of HPV 1OPC treated with primary TOS and
reduced PORT to document the kinetics of locoregional versusdistant recurrence, which may have implications for follow-up
schedule using imaging and clinical exam. A planned phase III
trial is in development using the arm (50 Gy) regimen as theexperimental arm, because of a combination of favorableoncologic and toxicity results from PROs presented here, to becompared with standard-of-care CRT.
TOS with dose-reduced postoperative therapy is one of
several deintensi ﬁcation approaches being studied inHPV1OPC.
14,32-34None of these deintensi ﬁcation ap-
proaches has been directly compared with standard of
care or an alternate deintensi ﬁcation strategy in a com-
pleted phase III trial, although such trials are ongoing
(NCT03952585 ). Optimal deintensi ﬁcation strategies may
differ for patients with different clinical risk features andanatomic suitability for TOS, and perhaps by molecularcharacteristics. The outstanding oncologic and functionalresults of our study provide compelling rationale for a phaseIII trial comparing the E3311 arm B regimen with standardCRT using 70 Gy of radiation and concurrent cisplatin
across all tobacco risk groups.
Patients with HPV 1OPC experience a profound, acute
decrement in general physical functioning and cancer-speci ﬁc QOL as a result of surgical and nonsurgical
treatments, and a signi ﬁcant percentage of patients fail to
return to baseline functioning. Here, we provide initialanalyses of QOL and swallowing outcomes, measured
using validated PROs. Clear decrement of both outcomes
during adjuvant treatment was observed, with modestdifferences seen between arms B and C and the intensi ﬁed
arm D. Whether differences emerge in long-term PRO ( .5
years) because of reduction in RT dose and avoidance ofcisplatin chemotherapy will be of interest to compare.
Future enhancement of this approach to deintensi ﬁcation
would result from better patient selection, to avoid higher-
risk (arm D) patients undergoing TOS followed by che-moradiation. Such preoperative patient selection might be
accomplished using radiomics, genomic or transcriptional
selection, or other methods to better de ﬁne those truly at
increased risk. For example, the most common indication
in our trial for inclusion in arm D was ENE .1 mm but it
remains unknown at what threshold ENE is oncologically
meaningful for resected HPV 1OPC. For arm D –like higher-
risk patients, alternative therapeutic regimens such as
reducing RT and/or chemotherapy dose, or replacing the
latter with targeted therapeutic agents or immunotherapy
should also be explored for deintensi ﬁcation.
35This group
could also be monitored clinically and risk-strati ﬁed using
surrogates for residual tumor such as salivary or circulating
tumor DNA. Others are already testing some of these
possibilities,30,36including lower RT or omitting chemo-
therapy for arm D –like patients with more extensive ENE.
With the very high PFS rates demonstrated here, continued
focus on minimizing late consequences of curative therapy
remains of great importance for this growing population of
patients.

 APPENDIX.
Procedures
Brieﬂy, patients with resectable p16 1oropharynx cancer (American
Joint Committee on Cancer-seventh edition tumor stage III-IVa withoutevidence for distant metastasis) and no evidence of matted or ﬁxed
pathologic adenopathy provided written informed consent and un-derwent radiographic staging. Adherence to contraindications to TOSwas recommended during investigator communications; this includedno gross or radiographic evidence of ENE (Weinstein, GS et al: Eur Arch
Otorhinolaryngol 272:1551-1552, 2015). Patients were required to
have adequate end-organ function and not to have previously receivedradiation above the clavicles. Full eligibility criteria are listed in the trialProtocol section 3.1. Primary treatment was TOS and neck dissection,followed by risk-based adjuvant therapy by arm assignment, which wasreviewed and con ﬁrmed centrally. TOS consisted of transoral robotic
surgery, transoral laser microsurgery, or standard cautery equipment,and approximately 90% of the patients were accrued by transoralrobotic surgery –credentialed surgeons, as published previously by
Ferris et al.
17Patients with N3 disease but no high-risk (arm D) features
(N51) received 60 Gy PORT (arm C). Sensitivity analyses were
conducted with the exclusion of this one patient. Con ﬁrmation of el-
igibility was repeated upon registration to step 2 (Appendix Tables A2
and A3).
Postoperative radiotherapy was based on pathologic risk strati ﬁcation
guiding radiation therapy dose prescription to the region of the pharynxor neck demonstrating the risk features. PORT was administered to theprimary site and neck, with the primary site volume de ﬁned by the
invasive tumor base rather than preoperative imaging that may haveincluded intraluminal tumor (Appendix Table A4 ). Ipsilateral neck
PORT could be elected if the mucosal invasive tumor base was .1c m
from the midline mucosa as determined at the time of the surgery and ifprimary tumor adverse pathologic features were not present on themedial tumor margin. The standard PORT dose was a minimum of
60 Gy with the exception of patients assigned to arm B, for whom 50 Gy
was prescribed to the primary site and the involved dissected neck.
Adverse events were evaluated by NCI Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events Version 4 (CTCAE V4) and assessed at baseline,weekly during radiotherapy, end of treatment, and 1 and 3 months
after treatment completion (St Guily JL, et al: J Clin Virol 51:100-104,
2011; Appendix Tables A5 andA6). Criteria for dose reduction or delay
were prespeci ﬁed. Per Protocol, disease assessment (physical ex-
amination, including laryngopharyngoscopy and if indicated, com-puted tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the head andneck, and late adverse event were required every 3 months for 2 years,every 6 months through year 5, and then annually). Chest x-ray orcomputed tomography of chest was performed annually. PRO in-cluded head and neck –cancer speci ﬁc quality of life (FACT-HN) and
swallowing perception and performance (MDADI) (Appendix Tables
A7andA8, online only). The FACT-H&N is a self-reported instrument,
which consists of a 27-item core (functional assessment of cancertherapy-general) and 10 head and neck –speci ﬁc items. Items are
rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale. The score ranges from 0 to 148,with higher scores indicative of higher quality of life. Change in scorewas categorized as improved (change $7 points), stable
(–6#change #6), or worsened (change #–7). The MDADI is also a
self-reported instrument, which consists of 20 items that assess an
individual ’s perception of their swallowing ability. Items are rated on a
5-point scale. The composite score ranges from 20 (extremely lowfunctioning) to 100 (high functioning). PROs were assessed atbaseline, 4-6 weeks following surgery, end of treatment, and at 3, 6,12, and 24 months thereafter. Quality assurance review of surgicalquality and radiation therapy including stopping rules was performedper the trial Protocol.Outcomes
Primary end points are feasibility of prospective multi-institutionalstudy of TOS followed by risk-adjusted adjuvant therapy (AppendixTable A9 ), and 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) of 50 Gy or 60 Gy
PORT for patients with intermediate risk. Feasibility was assessedthrough interim monitoring of the (1) accrual rate during months 13-18after activation (required to be .80% of projected rate); (2) risk
distribution among the ﬁrst 59 patients completing transoral resection
(requiring at least 22 patients of intermediate risk); and (3) surgicalquality as assessed by the rate of grade 3-4 bleeding events duringsurgery or positive margins after surgery (interim analysis among theﬁrst 59 eligible patients requiring ,13 patients with either outcome).
Two-year PFS is de ﬁned as the proportion of patients alive and
progression-free at 24 months, among all evaluable (eligible andtreated on step 2) patients. Secondary end points include toxicity,
overall survival (OS), swallowing function, and PROs. Comparisons of
2-year PFS rates between arms B and C, arms B and D, and arms Cand D were speci ﬁed as exploratory end points.
Statistical Design and Analyses
Planned interim analyses included 1-year PFS rates for arms A, B and
C, as well as surgical quality and risk distribution within the ﬁrst 59
patients completing surgery. Because this interim analysis demon-strated a higher-than-projected proportion of evaluable patients withhigh-risk features, the total accrual goal was increased from 377 to 515(protocol amendment January 2016) to assure an adequate sample ofintermediate-risk patients.
Among the 359 evaluable patients, 38 patients had follow-up for
,24 months. Therefore, 2-year PFS (and OS) was estimated using
the Kaplan-Meier method, rather than as a binomial proportion.Corresponding 90% CIs were estimated using Greenwood ’s formula.
PFS was measured from registration to step 2 to progression or deathbecause of any cause, and patients without documented progressionor death were censored at last disease evaluation date. OS was de ﬁned
as the time from registration to step 2 to death from any cause or
censored at last date known alive. When last disease evaluation date
was not available, patients were censored at their date of registration.
Secondary quality-of-life objectives included the comparison of the
change in FACT-HN total score from baseline (before TOS) to 6 monthsafter treatment, between arms B and C combined and arm D. A one-
sided Fisher ’s exact test was used to compare the proportion of pa-
tients with improved or stable score at 6 months after treatment,between arms B or C and D. A prespeci ﬁed exploratory comparison
between arms B and C was also performed. A one-sided Fisher ’s exact
test was used to compare the toxicity rates of arms B versus C, B versusD, and C versus D.
Our plan was to select arm B or arm C as the experimental arm in a
phase III comparison with de ﬁnitive chemoradiation. Therefore, a
prespeci ﬁed exploratory comparison was made of the 2-year PFS rate
between arms B and C. Prespeci ﬁed exploratory comparisons of PFS
between arms B and D, and arms C and D, were also performed, with adivided type I error (0.025 each), for a family-wise error rate of 0.10. Alog-rank test was used to compare PFS between groups. Toxicityanalyses were performed on all patients treated on step 2, whereas allother prespeci ﬁed analyses were performed on the cohort of evaluable
patients.
Several post hoc analyses were performed, including exploratory
analyses of (1) ineligible patients only and (2) all step 2 treated pa-tients, for PFS, OS, and change in FACT-HN total score from baselineto 6-month post-treatment. Additionally, an exploratory comparison ofPFS was done, by smoking history ( .10v#10 pack-years) for arms
B, C, and D (evaluable patients). The ﬁnal data lock was November 30,
2020.
