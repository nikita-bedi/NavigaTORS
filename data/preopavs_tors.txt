BEFORE YOUR SURGERY
 
1. PLANNING- Planning is the key element for any surgery. Arrange any responsibilities at home in order to minimize responsibilities after surgery. Please bring a valid photo I.D. and your insurance card when checking in for surgery. 
 
2. AN EMPTY STOMACH- Do NOT eat or drink anything after midnight the day before your surgery. This includes candy, mints and gum. Daily medication can be taken the morning of surgery IF cleared with the prescribing physician and your surgeon. (VERY IMPORTANT) 
 
3. INSURANCE AUTHORIZATION- Our authorization department will contact your insurance company to check eligibility of coverage for your upcoming surgery. They will also secure prior authorization or predetermination of medical necessity for your surgery IF your insurance company requires it. If there is an issue with your eligibility, denial of authorization or the proposed procedure is just not a covered benefit under the terms of your plan you will be notified prior to your surgery date to make an alternative arrangement such as up-front payment for your surgery or cancellation of your procedure. 
 
4. A RIDE HOME- Following surgery even if you spent a few nights in the hospital you MUST have a ride home. Depending on what type of surgery you may be having, arrange to have someone stay with you for a couple of days. 
 
5. DRESS- Wear casual, loose fitting clothes that button in the front and low-heeled shoes. Please do not wear any make-up, hairsprays, contacts, or jewelry. Leave all valuables at home. 
 
6. ASPIRIN/ASPIRIN CONTAINING PRODUCTS- Hospital policy requires that patients stop taking aspirin or aspirin containing products, including Ibuprofen, 2 weeks prior to and 1 week following their surgery. (VERY IMPORTANT) 
 
7. LABORATORY WORK- All lab work and pre-operative testing will be done at or just before your pre-operative appointment. You will also see anesthesia that day. These visits can take a few hours, please allow 2-3 hours for both appointments. 
 
8. LIST OF MEDICATIONS-Bring a list of your current medications including but not limited to: prescription medications, vitamins, supplements and OTC (over the counter) medications you take daily or on a regular basis to your preoperative and anesthesia appointments so that your surgeon and anesthesiologist can discuss these with you further. (VERY IMPORTANT) 
 
9. SKIN CARE- Wash the area of operation with antiseptic soap (and/or shampoo). Betadine, Providine, Iodine, Hibiclins or Dial Soap is recommended and may be obtained without a prescription. 
 
10. SMOKING- Stop smoking 2 months prior to your surgery. If you are a smoker your pre-op lab work may include a blood test to check your nicotine level. If it is found you are still smoking your surgery may be postponed.

Using Chlorhexidine Gluconate (CHG) Cloths
 
Preparing Your Skin before Surgery 
 Why am I cleaning my skin before surgery?
 
Cleaning your skin before surgery can reduce the risk of infection at your surgical site. To make the cleaning easier, Stanford Health Care has chosen disposable cloths moistened with a rinse-free, alcohol- free, 2% Clorhexidine Gluconate* (CHG) antiseptic solution. *  
 
You will be given two sets of CHG cloths. 
 
When do I use the cloths?
 
The night before surgery: 
 
Use the first set of six cloths. 
 
The morning of surgery: 
 
Use the second set of six cloths.
 
*Product warnings listed on product packaging.
 
Areas of body to wipe with cloths: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Instructions for use:
[Please read the “Don’t” section below before using this product]
 
#1 Cloth: Wipe your neck and chest.  
(Cover entire purple area).
 
#2 Cloth: Wipe the entire surface of both arms starting at your shoulders and ending at your fingertips. Be sure to spend extra time wiping your underarms. (Cover entire green area).
 
#3 Cloth: Wipe your right and left hips, followed by your groin area. Be sure to wipe folds in your belly and groin. Do not use on the genital areas.
(Cover entire orange area except genitals)
 
#4 Cloth: Wipe front of your legs, starting at the top of your thighs and ending with your toes. (Cover entire yellow area).
 
Try to get help with the fifth and sixth cloths.
 
#5 Cloth: Wipe your back, starting at the base of your neck and ending at the bottom of your buttocks. Do not use on the genital areas. (Cover entire pink area)
 
#6  Cloth: Wipe the back of both your legs, from the bottom of your buttocks down to and including the
soles of your feet. Be sure to thoroughly wipe behind your knees. (Cover entire blue area except genitals).
 
Do...
 
DO shower or bathe before you start using the cloths.
 
DO wait at least one hour after showering before using the cloths.
 
DO wait until skin is completely dry and cool before using the cloths.
 
DO use all six cloths to cleanse all six areas of your body as shown in the diagram.
 
DO wipe each area thoroughly.
 
DO let skin air dry after using the cloths. It is normal for your skin to feel a little sticky for a few minutes until the solution dries completely.
 
DO dress in something clean.
 
DO sleep on clean sheets.
 
Don't...
 
DON’T  microwave this product.
