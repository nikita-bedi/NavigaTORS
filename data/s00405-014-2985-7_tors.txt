0–7 %. Predictors of swallowing function included baseline function, T-stage, N-stage, tongue base primary tumors, and adjuvant chemoradiation. Rates of transient hyperna-sality were 4–9 %. A single study suggested dose-depend-
ent effects of adjuvant therapy (none, radiation alone, chemoradiation) on diet scores at 6 and 12 months. Crude end points of functional recovery after TORS ± adjuvant therapy suggest promising swallowing outcomes, depend-ing on the functional measure reported.

Introduction
The incidence of oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) is rising 
precipitously, and the annual number of cases in the USA is projected to almost double by the year 2030 [1]. Con-temporary OPC survivors, who predominantly present with HPV-associated disease, are younger, commonly diagnosed in the 5th decade, and have favorable prognosis for long-term survival. Treatment paradigms for OPC have shifted in recent decades, coincident with changes in the epidemi-ology of the disease. The use of “open” transmandibular surgery has declined as organ preservation regimens using radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy have become the core modalities of treatment for OPC. Pooled data from obser -
vational studies over 40 years (1970–2000) support this practice, citing equivalent locoregional control and survival Abstract  Summarize functional outcomes after transoral 
robotic surgery (TORS) ± adjuvant therapy for oropharyn-geal cancer (OPC). A systematic review was conducted. The MEDLINE database was searched (MeSH terms: TORS, pharyngeal neoplasms, oropharyngeal neoplasms). Peer-reviewed human subject papers published through December 2013 were included. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) case report design (n < 10), (2) review arti-cle, or (3) technical, animal, or cadaver studies. Functional outcomes extracted included feeding tube dependence, swallow examination findings, speech ratings, velopharyn-geal insufficiency, pneumonia, and oral intake measures. Twelve papers comprising 441 patients with OPC treated with TORS ± adjuvant therapy were included. Feeding 
tube rates were the most commonly reported functional outcome. Excluding prophylactic placement, 18–39 % of patients required gastrostomy placement, typically during adjuvant therapy. Chronic gastrostomy dependence ranged from 0 to 7 % (mean follow-up 11–26 months), regard-less of disease stage. Composite MD Anderson Dyspha-gia Inventory (MDADI) scores ranged from 65.2 to 78 (89 patients, 3 series, mean follow-up 12–13 months). Vide-ofluoroscopic swallowing studies were not systematically

with lower rates of severe (including gastrostomy and tra-
cheostomy) or fatal complications after nonsurgical therapy compared with definitive open surgery [2]. Meta-analyses also demonstrate survival benefits of chemoradiation over radiotherapy alone, and so concurrent chemoradiation regi-mens are now the mainstay of current treatment for OPC [3].
Swallowing is the primary functional priority of OPC 
survivors [4], with claims of superior swallowing func-tion after nonsurgical therapy compared with open surgery and postoperative radiation. For instance, a cross-sectional comparison of chemoradiation versus open surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy reported roughly 20–30 % better swallowing-related quality-of-life scores in long-term sur -
vivors after nonsurgical therapy despite more advanced-stage tumors in the chemoradiation group [5]. Nonetheless, chemoradiation can be associated with significant toxic-ity and adverse functional effects. Dysphagia is among the most commonly cited functional impairments in OPC survivors [4]. Gastrostomy placement is required in up to 62 % of OPC patients during definitive radiotherapy due to the acute toxicities of treatment, and as many as 23 % are 
still dependent on feeding tubes 6 months after treatment 
[6].
Dysphagia is also an important late complication. Severe 
(grade 3–4) late laryngopharyngeal toxicity was reported in 35 % of 101 OPC survivors who had adequate baseline function in a pooled analysis of 3 RTOG trials of concomi-tant chemoradiotherapy [7], and the 3-year prevalence of dysphagia approached 50 % in a population-level analysis 
of OPC survivors in the SEER-Medicare database [8]. In addition, late onset of radiation-associated dysphagia (late-RAD) is a rare but particularly devastating delayed toxicity of nonsurgical organ preservation among OPC survivors, associated with progressive functional deterioration even decades after treatment [9]. Thus, current data strongly sug-gest that both early and long-term swallowing outcomes are a key metric of successful organ preservation after OPC.
Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) has emerged as a 
minimally invasive approach of endoscopic head and neck surgery (eHNS) as an alternative to nonsurgical organ preservation regimens in OPC. The proposed functional advantages of TORS are many. TORS allows access for oropharyngeal resection without pharyngotomy or man-dibulotomy, maintaining the critical muscular framework of the laryngopharynx necessary to preserve swallow-ing function. Tracheostomy, typically required for airway management after open resection, is also avoided in most (70–100 %) TORS cases, regardless of adjuvant therapy [10, 11]. Finally, proponents of a primary surgical approach 
with TORS cite the potential to de-escalate radiotherapy to postoperative doses or to avoid concomitant chemotherapy or radiotherapy altogether as a major functional advantage of TORS. Collectively, published series suggest that 9–27 % of patients treated with frontline TORS avoid post-
operative radiotherapy and 34–45 % avoid chemoradiother -
apy [10–14]. These advantages are proposed to preserve swallowing function in properly selected patients treated with TORS. A number of authors have reported functional outcomes of TORS for OPC, but these data have not been comprehensively summarized. The purpose of this system-atic review was to summarize functional outcomes after TORS (±adjuvant therapy) for OPC in published literature, with particular emphasis on swallowing-related outcomes.
Methods
Search methodsThe primary search for this systematic review was con-
ducted using the electronic MEDLINE database (data source: OVID). The search was limited to human sub-ject research in peer-reviewed journal articles published through December 2013. Medical subject heading (MeSH) terms were used to identify papers for 2 groups of terms: (1) TORS (MeSH term: TORS; 159 papers retrieved) and (2) pharyngeal neoplasms or oropharyngeal neoplasms (MeSH terms: pharyngeal neoplasms, oropharyngeal neo-plasms; 25,329 papers retrieved). The final MEDLINE search identified 55 papers by cross-referencing the two groups of terms for common papers. The bibliographies of relevant articles were then hand-searched to identify addi-tional manuscripts. Hand-searching identified 5 additional papers.
Selection criteria and data collectionThe abstracts of 60 peer-reviewed journal articles identi-
fied by electronic and hand searches were screened. Arti-cles were excluded during the screening process accord-ing to the following exclusion criteria: 1) case report study design (n < 10), 2) review article, or 3) technical, animal, or cadaver studies. The full text of 27 articles was reviewed for the following data points: sample size, study methods, patient demographics, site and stage of disease, HPV or p16 status, prior treatment, adjuvant treatment, follow-up time, methods of functional assessment and rehabilitation, and functional outcomes. Functional outcomes extracted included measures of feeding tube dependence, instrumen-tal and clinical swallow evaluations, patient-reported out-come (PRO) measures, speech outcomes, velopharyngeal insufficiency, pneumonia, and diet. After full-text review, articles that reported any speech and/or swallowing-related outcomes among OPC patients treated with primary TORS (regardless of adjuvant treatment[s]) were included.

comprised of ≥20 % of salvage cases were excluded to 
focus on functional outcomes after TORS as a primary therapeutic modality. Ten articles that met inclusion criteria after full-text review were summarized in this systematic review. Data from two overlapping cohorts were included because they reported complementary functional data and had varied inclusion criteria [11, 14–16]. Search results are 
illustrated in Fig. 1. Results were summarized in descrip-tive format. Statistical analyses were conducted using the STATA data analysis statistical software, version 10.0 (StataCorp LP, www.stata.com, College Station, TX).
Results
Population characteristicsA total of 441 patients in 12 papers were systematically 
reviewed. Sample sizes ranged from 12 to 66 OPC patients among individual studies. All were single-institution case series (level 4 evidence). Three studies reported on TORS for advanced (III–IV) [11, 14, 17], and one study reported 
outcomes for early (T1–T2) OPC tumors [10]. The remain-ing 8 studies reported outcomes after TORS for all stages of disease (AJCC I–IV). Adjuvant radiotherapy was delivered in 63–100 % of cases, with chemoradiation in 18–63 %. Neck dissections were performed in 41–100 % of TORS cases. Only 2 of 12 papers reported HPV status of patients, both of which reported that the majority of TORS cases were HPV + (72–80 %). None stratified functional outcomes by HPV status.
Feeding tubesFeeding tube rates were reported in all 12 studies. Table 1 
outlines rates of perioperative feeding tube placement, PEG placement, and chronic PEG dependence. Rates of perio-perative feeding tube placement varied widely by disease stage and institutional practices (3–100 %), and the average duration of perioperative nasogastric tubes was 2–13 days [11, 13, 17, 18]. Excluding prophylactic placement [15], 
18–39 % of patients required gastrostomy placement, typically during adjuvant therapy. A single study of radi-cal tonsillectomy reported the placement of gastrostomy tubes intraoperatively in all patients [15]. PEG placement 
did not differ significantly when stratified by AJCC stage [12], but one series reported PEG placement exclusively in patients with T3 or T4 tumors and mostly in patients with tongue base primaries [11]. Chronic gastrostomy depend-ence was reported in 11 of 12 studies and ranged from 0 to 7 % (mean follow-up 11–32 months), regardless of disease stage. Postoperative chemotherapy was found to indepen-dently predict for prolonged gastrostomy (>3 months) after TORS [10].
PEG utilization was compared as a marker of acute 
swallowing morbidity among primary TORS (± adjuvant therapy) series and definitive intensity-modulated radio-therapy (IMRT ± systemic therapy) series. Excluding stud-
ies that restricted inclusion to early-stage disease and those that routinely prophylactically placed PEG tubes, 18–39 % of patients required PEG tubes in TORS series [11–13, 16, 
18, 19] compared with 29–60 % of patients in definitive 
IMRT series [6, 20–25] (Fig. 2).
Oral intakeMeasures of oral intake or dietary outcomes were reported 
in 8 studies. Time to oral intake varied by T-stage (Table 2). 
Oral intake was earlier among 3 series that excluded T4 tumors [12, 13]; 96 % of patients began oral intake on POD 
#1 after TORS for T1–T2 tumors [12], and mean time to 
oral intake was 2 days after TORS for T1–T3 OPC tumors [13]. In contrast, only 51 % of patients began oral intake on POD #1 after TORS when data were reported for patients of all T-stages (T1–T4) [11]. Among series including all T-stages, 69–73 % began oral intake by discharge [18, 26], 
83 % by week 2 [26], and 89 % by week 4 [11].
Two studies longitudinally assessed dietary outcomes

Neck (PSS-HN) [13, 19]. Leonhardt et al. reported a sta-
tistically significant drop in Normalcy of Diet scale scores 
from baseline (96.1 ± 17.0) to 6 months (74.4 ± 34.0); diet scores improved thereafter and were no longer significantly depressed at 12 months (84.2 ± 26.3) [19]. These diet scores reflect, on average, a change from unrestricted sol-ids preoperatively to restricted solids (e.g., avoiding certain meats or dry foods) at post-TORS intervals. Similarly, Gen-den et al. reported that mean PSS-HN diet scores reached a nadir near 25 points (equivalent to a liquid/blended diet) 2 months after TORS and rose precipitously to near-normal levels (approximately 90 points) by 12 months [13]. Sig-nificant drops in dietary scores 2–6 months after TORS in these series were likely in part attributed to acute toxicities of adjuvant therapy.
Swallowing outcomesBeyond feeding tube data, measures of swallowing-related 
outcomes varied widely among the 12 studies included in this review (Table 3). Outcomes of instrumental swal-
lowing studies were rarely reported. Fiber-optic endo-scopic evaluations of swallowing (FEES) were performed longitudinally from baseline through 1 year after TORS (postoperatively at 2 weeks, 2, 6, 9, and 12 months) in a single study [13]. Discrete data were not reported, but the authors reported that no patients developed aspiration or velopharyngeal reflux per FEES. Videofluoroscopic swal-lowing assessments were not systematically performed among the 12 studies. Thus, MBS outcomes could not be analyzed in this systematic review (Table 3). 
Swallowing outcomes were summarized according to 
the clinician-rated Functional Outcome Swallowing Score (FOSS) [27] pre- and post-TORS (4 weeks) in one series [11]; median FOSS scores were 1 indicative of “compen-sated abnormal swallow function” at both intervals. In addition, FOSS scores returned to normal (FOSS = 0) by the 4-week assessment interval in all patients who had nor -
mal baseline swallows (FOSS = 0) and avoided adjuvant radiotherapy [11].
Swallowing-related quality of life was measured in 
three studies using the validated MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI); 19-item composite summary scores were calculated per Chen et al. [28]. Composite MDADI scores reported among 89 patients in 3 studies at a mean follow-up of 12–13 months ranged from 65.2 to 78 [10, 17, 
26]. Finally, the incidence of postoperative pneumonia was reported in 3 studies and ranged from 0 to 7 % [14, 15, 18].Table 1  Rates of feeding tube placement and dependence after TORS for OPC

Predictors of swallowing function
Predictors of swallowing function included baseline func-
tion, T-stage, nodal status, base of tongue primary tumors, and adjuvant chemoradiation. T3 or T4 primary tumors were found to differentiate FOSS scores and PEG utiliza-tion in one study [11], whereas N-stage independently predicted persistently poor long-term swallowing-related quality of life per MDADI scores in another study [10]. Similarly, resections of >50 % of the base of tongue pre-dicted poorly compensated dysphagia (per FOSS > 2) and prolonged PEG dependence [11].
A single study stratified functional outcomes by adju-
vant treatment (none, RT alone, chemo-RT), reporting near-normal speech, diet, and eating ≥6 months after TORS alone per the Performance Status Scale Head and Neck (PSS-HN). Dose-dependent effects of adjuvant therapy were apparent in diet scores at 6 and 12 months. Relative to TORS alone, diet scores were 23 and 16 % lower in patients who received adjuvant RT and 53 and 36 % lower in patients who received adjuvant chemo-RT at 6 and 12 months, respectively [19].
TracheostomyRates of tracheostomy were reported in 11 of 12 stud-
ies (Table 4), ranging from 0 to 31 %. Two institutions reported tracheostomy rates in excess of 20 %, presum-ably in cases with advanced-stage tumors, but this strati-fication was not specified [11, 13, 16]. Among all papers 
(pooled n = 411 cases reporting tracheostomy rates), only 
two patients were permanently tracheostomy dependent [14, 16]. When reported, mean tracheostomy dependence 
ranged from 7 to 8 days [11, 14].
SpeechSpeech-related outcomes were described in 5 series [11, 13, 
15, 19, 29]. Summary speech ratings were taken longitudi-
nally in 3 studies, according to the clinician-rated PSS-HN 
Understandability of Speech scale [30] in 2 series [13, 19] 
and using an ordinal, nonvalidated speech grade (normal, minor, gross) in the remaining [11]. The former reported PSS-HN speech scores above 75 (indicating “understand-able most of the time” or better) at all post-TORS intervals, and speech received “normal” ratings on the initial post-TORS rating in the latter series. Transient hypernasality was reported in 3–9 % of patients in 3 studies [11, 15, 29].
Long-term function after TORS
Long-term gastrostomy tube rates were reported in 426 
patients from 11 studies and ranged from 0 to 7 %, with mean follow-up in most studies between 1 and 2 years (Table 1 ). 
Long-term outcomes data from instrumental swallowing stud-ies were not quantified in any of the 12 studies. Longitudinal studies only quantified functional outcomes with standard-ized metrics to 1 year after TORS and reported near-baseline

and those that prophylactically placed PEG tubes in all patients, 18–39 % (median 23 %) required gastrostomy tubes in TORS series com-pared with 29–60 % (median 46 %) of patients in definitive IMRT series

diet levels per the PSS-HN (mean diet scores >80, reflecting 
solid diet with few restrictions) at 1 year [13, 19]. Similarly 
favorable outcomes were reported with regard to long-term airway and speech functioning. Only two patients among the total 411 pooled (reporting tracheostomy rates) from all stud-ies were permanently tracheostomy dependent, and both were in series that included advanced-stage tumors.
Discussion
HPV-associated cancers now account for roughly 70 % of 
new OPC cases [1]. HPV-associated OPCs are clinically distinct from tobacco-related cancers, diagnosed at a younger age with favorable prognosis for long-term sur -
vival. Thus, function-sparing treatment is a chief goal for this population. Unfortunately, dysphagia remains a signifi-cant toxicity of current organ preservation strategies that have intensified over time by the addition of concurrent chemotherapy and accelerated fractionation schedules of radiotherapy [31, 32]. Cooperative group trials and popu-
lation-based data suggest an excess burden of dysphagia in HNC patients treated with chemoradiotherapy compared with other treatment modalities [7, 8]. Herein, we report 
promising early functional results of a frontline surgical organ preservation strategy with TORS for OPC, with par -
ticular emphasis on swallowing outcomes. Early data are limited, however, by lack of systematic functional assess-ment using instrumental examinations and by short follow-up time.
Published end points of functional recovery after TORS 
suggest encouraging early outcomes. Rates of feeding tube placement and dependence after TORS were lower than published benchmarks in IMRT series of patients with OPC. However, scores from PRO questionnaires reported in TORS series in this review had significant overlap with scores previously published in chemoradiation cohorts. Specifically, summary MDADI scores (based on 19-item composite scores) from TORS series ranged from 65.2 to 78 [10, 17, 26] compared with 73.6 to 74.1 in published 
series of OPC patients treated with nonsurgical chemora-diation approach [5, 33]. Selection bias is a clear limita-
tion when comparing outcomes of relatively small, single-institution TORS series to published benchmarks in larger, more inclusive IMRT series. Controlled comparisons are needed.Table 3  Measures of swallowing-related outcomes

Direct comparisons of surgical with nonsurgical 
approaches are limited in published literature, particularly 
with regard to functional outcomes. Two case–control stud-ies support a swallowing-specific functional advantage of primary transoral surgery over primary chemoradia-tion for OPC. An unmatched case–control study included this review reported better MDADI scores in the primary TORS cases compared to controls treated with chemo-radiation. The authors found time-dependent significant differences in MDADI scores between treatment groups in favor of a primary TORS approach. No significant dif-ferences were observed in MDADI scores at 3 months, but patients treated with TORS have significantly better scores at 6 and 12 months, suggesting better long-term recovery after primary TORS compared with chemoradia-tion. Trends of better swallowing-related QOL in the TORS group were maintained when stratified by T-stage or oro-pharyngeal tumor subsite. Likewise, gastrostomy duration was shorter in the TORS (+adjuvant therapy) group com-pared with the primary chemoradiation group (mean dura-tion gastrostomy: 3 months versus 6 months, respectively) [17]. Similarly, a retrospective matched-pairs comparison of primary transoral surgery (robotic or laser) with primary chemoradiation reported no difference in overall quality of life at 1 year between groups, but significantly better self-
reported swallowing on the University of Washington Qual-ity of Life Scale. Notably, 74 % of patients treated with primary transoral surgery reported swallowing “as well as ever” at 1 year compared with only 32 % of patients in the chemoradiation group [35]. Findings from both of these case–control studies favor better long-term swallowing recovery with upfront transoral surgery (robotic or laser) and adjuvant radiation at postoperative doses. Nevertheless, retrospective and historical comparisons do not adequately account for confounding factors that influence functional outcomes. Regardless of treatment modality, swallowing outcomes are highly dependent on baseline function and T-stage [11, 34], and thus, historical comparisons between 
TORS and radiation series should be interpreted with cau-tion. Randomized, baseline-adjusted comparisons, as are currently planned in cooperative group trials, are needed to draw definitive conclusions.
Published data also suggest that swallowing physiol-
ogy might be preserved for many patients after frontline TORS, as aspiration is rarely cited after this approach [13]. This compares well with published estimates that suggest that up to 31 % of patients develop chronic aspiration after 
chemo-IMRT for OPC [25]. This notion, however, is quite preliminary because a major limitation of functional data in the TORS series is that findings of instrumental swallowing assessments (e.g., modified barium swallow [MBS] stud-ies, fiber-optic endoscopic evaluations [FEES]) are rarely reported. Future trials should include instrumental studies of swallowing function as a key component of multidimen-sional swallowing assessment, along with PRO measures. More specifically, physiologic impairment quantified from the MBS study has been shown to predict quality of life, and MBS end points of aspiration and pharyngeal resi-due significantly predict post-treatment pneumonia after treatment for OPC (p = 0.017, Se 80 %, Sp 60 %) [36, 
37]. These data offer compelling support for inclusion of instrumental assessment, particularly the MBS, in TORS trials, as the data obtained from MBS cannot be reliably inferred from subjective, self-report of swallowing function obtained from PRO measures.
Functional outcomes are most consistently studied in the 
first year after TORS. It is arguable, however, that the most salient functional advantage of TORS may be the potential to avoid late toxicities associated with definitive radiother -
apy and chemoradiotherapy. Growing evidence suggests a risk of new onset or progressive dysphagia (“late-RAD”) as a late effect of primary radiation-based organ preser -
vation regimens in 5- and 10-year survivors. Late-RAD is associated with profound functional impairment, often accompanied by cranial neuropathies and a constellation of functional problems. Although rare, late-RAD is a dev-astating delayed complication of therapy and refractory to exhaustive therapies and should motivate investigation into alternative treatment paradigms in high-risk patients [9]. A comprehensive assessment of long-term functional out-comes after a frontline TORS approach is not yet available in published literature. Various transoral surgical methods (robotic or laser resection) are expected to have fairly com-parable functional effects, although direct comparisons have not been reported. Five-year data after transoral laser microsurgery suggest favorable swallowing outcomes (per FOSS) in patients with T1–T3 oropharyngeal disease, but suboptimal swallowing recovery in patients with T4 tumors [34]. Comparable long-term follow-up in TORS series is needed. Furthermore, current literature lacks consensus regarding the optimal assessment of functional outcomes in patients treated with TORS, and comparisons among pub-lished reports are challenging. Long-term functional data that clearly define physiology along with PROs are critical to fully understand the potential advantages of this modal-ity. Most importantly, detailed functional analyses will ultimately help to define the salient group of patients most likely to benefit from a TORS approach.
Conclusions
Early studies of functional recovery after TORS ±  adjuvant 
therapy suggest promising swallowing outcomes, depending 
on the end point measured. Gastrostomy utilization is lower in primary TORS series relative to published benchmarks  470 Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol (2015) 272:463–471

studied, and trends are less consistent using these out-come measures, but direct comparisons with nonsurgical therapy suggest favorable long-term PRO outcomes after upfront transoral surgery. Findings of instrumental swallow-ing assessments (MBS or FEES) and long-term outcomes have also not been widely used and reported. Functional outcomes after TORS are highly dependent on baseline function, T-stage, and adjuvant treatment. Randomized, baseline-adjusted outcomes are needed to discern the func-tional differences between primary TORS and nonsurgical approaches to organ preservation for OPC.
