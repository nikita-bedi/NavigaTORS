Simple Summary: Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS) has become widely adopted for the surgical
removal of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). However, it is currently unknown if
TORS has equal efﬁcacy and outcomes in patients with tonsillar or base of tongue (BOT) OPSCC.
Therefore, we performed a systematic review, including articles describing the surgical management
of OPSCC with TORS that compared margin status, complications, and recurrence between tonsil
and BOT. BOT OPSCC had a higher rate of positive margins compared to tonsillar OPSCC. However,
no differences were seen in the recurrence or postoperative hemorrhage rates of BOT and tonsillar
OPSCC. While a higher rate of positive margins was seen in BOT OPSCC when compared to tonsillar
OPSCC, this did not translate to a higher recurrence rate in the BOT group. Future research on which
subset of patients with BOT is more likely to have positive margins is warranted to improve the
utility of TORS further.
Abstract: Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS) has become widely adopted for the surgical removal of
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), with the most common locations being in the tonsil
and base of tongue (BOT). However, it is currently unknown if TORS has equal efﬁcacy and outcomes
in patients with tonsillar or BOT OPSCC. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the margin
status and recurrence rates of tonsillar and BOT OPSCC after TORS. Per PRISMA guidelines, PubMed,
Scopus, and CINAHL were systematically searched from inception to 2/28/2022. Articles including
the surgical management of OPSCC with TORS that compared margin status, complications, and
recurrence between tonsil and BOT were included. Meta-analyses of proportions and odds ratios
were performed. A total of 28 studies were included, comprising 1769 patients with tonsillar OPSCC
and 1139 patients with BOT OPSCC. HPV positivity was seen in 92.3% of tumors. BOT OPSCC had
a higher rate of positive margins compared to tonsillar OPSCC (28.1% [95%CI 15.1–43.3] vs. 7.5%
[95%CI 3.3–13.3]). No differences were seen in recurrence between BOT and tonsillar OPSCC (OR
1.1 [95%CI 0.8–1.5], p= 0.480). In addition, no differences in postoperative hemorrhage were seen
between tonsillar and BOT OPSCC (10.7% [95%CI 6.1–16.5] vs. 8.8% [95% CI 1.5–21.3]). While a
higher rate of positive margins was seen in BOT OPSCC when compared to tonsil OPSCC, this did
not translate to a higher recurrence rate in the BOT group. Future research on which subset of patients
with BOT is more likely to have positive margins is warranted to improve the utility of TORS further.

1. Introduction
The incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has consistently
risen over the past 40 years, secondary to an increase in human papillomavirus (HPV)-
Cancers 2022 ,14, 3837. https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14153837 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cancers Cancers 2022 ,14, 3837 2 of 17
positive tumors [ 1–3]. OPSCC used to primarily be associated with tobacco and alcohol
use, which has been shown to lead to a more aggressive disease pathology compared to
HPV-associated OPSCC [ 4–6]. Secondary to the changing etiologies and pathogeneses of
OPSCC, different therapeutic approaches and techniques, such as de-escalation strategies,
are currently being explored to improve survival and long-term outcomes in patients with
OPSCC [ 4,7]. Evidence shows that upfront transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is as effective
as chemoradiotherapy, and it has been widely adopted for the treatment of T1 and T2
primary OPSCC [ 8]. While TORS was initially used in the surgical resection of tonsillar
OPSCC, it has now advanced to also removing base of tongue (BOT) tumors [9–11].
However, there is currently limited and conﬂicting evidence on if there are varying sur-
gical outcomes between the two most common sites of OPSCC: the tonsil and BOT [ 10]. One
retrospective study noticed difﬁculty gaining proper exposure in BOT OPSCC compared to
tonsillar OPSCC [ 12]. The authors also felt that the cryptic lingual tonsillar mucosa com-
pared to the smooth mucosa of the tonsil made it more challenging to identify the extent of
the tumor, particularly at the deep margin, which can be the hardest to clear [ 12,13]. While
postoperative positive margins are crucial for the decision to perform adjuvant therapy,
there is conﬂicting evidence on its utility when considering long-term survival [ 14,15]. One
study found that patients requiring more intraoperative attempts to achieve a negative
margin had a higher rate of death due to cancer [ 16], but two other studies did not ﬁnd any
changes in survival when comparing patients with positive margins to negative margins in
HPV-positive OPSCC after TORS [17,18].
It is currently unknown if surgical outcomes differ between tonsillar and BOT OPSCC
after TORS. Therefore, we performed a systematic review of the literature to analyze
tumor margin status and recurrence rates after TORS. Secondarily, we also aimed to
see if complication rates differed between the subsites. Our initial hypothesis was that
BOT OPSCC would have increased rates of positive margins after TORS, which would
translate to higher rates of recurrence when compared to patients with tonsillar OPSCC.
We also hypothesized that BOT tumors would have more complications secondary to more
technically challenging removals and attempts at negative margins.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Search Criteria
This systematic review was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [ 19]. Two authors (N.S.P . and
T.C.) developed search strategies for the following databases: PubMed (National Library
of Medicine, National Institutes of Health); Scopus (Elsevier); and CINAHL (EBSCO) to
identify studies for inclusion. These strategies used a combination of subject headings (e.g.,
Medical Subject Headings [MeSH] in PubMed) and keywords for the concepts oropharyn-
geal squamous cell carcinoma and TORS. The PubMed search strategy was developed ﬁrst
and then used to design the search strategies for the other two databases; MeSH terms were
replaced with appropriate subject headings and similar keywords when available. The
search strategies are detailed in Appendix A. The databases were searched from inception
to 28 February 2022. The reference lists of relevant articles and citing articles were manually
searched to conﬁrm the search strategy and identify additional articles. All the articles
were uploaded to the review management software Covidence (Veritas health innovation
Ltd., Melbourne, Australia) and screened for relevance.
2.2. Selection Criteria
Studies that described cases of OPSCC treated with TORS were considered for inclu-
sion. Double- or single-blinded randomized controlled trials, double- or single-blinded
randomized comparison trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and prospective or retro-
spective observational studies were considered for inclusion. Speciﬁcally, cases must have
described outcome data pertaining to the TORS surgery to be considered for inclusion. For
this review, the outcomes of postoperative margin status, hemorrhage, and locoregional Cancers 2022 ,14, 3837 3 of 17
or metastatic recurrence were the primary outcomes of interest. Studies were excluded
if they did not detail these three outcome variables based on either the tonsillar or BOT
subsite. Furthermore, studies were excluded if outcomes were not speciﬁcally after TORS,
such as with transoral or laser surgery. Studies that combined their outcome data from
OPSCC with other malignancies were excluded. The remaining exclusion criteria included
cancer database studies, case reports with less than four tonsillar or BOT OPSCC patients,
non-English studies, and non-human studies.
Titles and abstracts were ﬁrst independently screened by two reviewers (N.S.P . and
T.C.) to identify the records that met the inclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved in
discussion with a third reviewer (S.A.N.). Next, the full texts of the selected records were
independently assessed by both N.S.P . and T.C. to ﬁnd which articles met all the inclusion
and exclusion criteria necessary to be included in the ﬁnal analysis. Any conﬂicts were
resolved by S.A.N. The level of evidence for each selected article was evaluated with the
Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine [ 20]. The risk of bias for each selected report
was assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
Version 6.0 [ 21]. The Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies – of Interventions (ROBINS-I)
tool was utilized because all the ﬁnal selected studies were non-randomized studies [ 22].
The consistency of the risk of bias assessment was checked by the two authors (N.S.P . and
T.C.) performing a pilot assessment on three studies and comparing for accuracy. Both then
performed an independent risk assessment on the remaining studies. All disagreements
were resolved by discussion with a third reviewer (S.A.N.). The risk of bias items included
the following: bias due to confounding, bias in the selection of participants for the study,
bias in the classiﬁcation of interventions, bias due to deviations from the intended inter-
ventions, bias due to missing data, bias in the measurement of outcomes, and bias in the
selection of the reported results. The risk of bias for each aspect was graded as low, unclear,
or high.
2.3. Data Extraction
Two reviewers (N.S.P . and T.C.) independently extracted the data and compared for
accuracy. The author; year of publication; country of study; demographics, including age
and gender; and smoking status were recorded. In addition, disease characteristics for
the entire cohort of patients were collected, including p16/HPV status, T-stage, N-stage,
perineural invasion, extranodal extension, lymphovascular invasion, and extrascapular
spread. The presence of neck dissection and adjuvant therapy (radiotherapy or chemora-
diotherapy) was also recorded. The following outcomes speciﬁc to tonsillar or BOT subsite
were extracted: the number of positive margins, locoregional and metastatic recurrence,
and postoperative hemorrhage. Locoregional and metastatic recurrence was combined
into the variable total recurrence. If a study did not specify whether the recurrence was
locoregional or metastatic, those cases were counted only under total recurrence.
2.4. Statistical Analysis
Meta-analyses of odds ratios (comparison of locoregional recurrence, metastatic recur-
rence, and total recurrence) between BOT and tonsil were performed with Cochrane Review
Manager (RevMan) version 5.4 (The Cochrane Collaboration 2020). A meta-analysis of
proportions was performed using MedCalc 19.6 (MedCalc Software Ltd., Ostend, Belgium;
https://www.medcalc.org; accessed on 4 May 2020). The pooled prevalence rate of positive
margin and hemorrhage for BOT and tonsil were expressed as a percentage with their 95%
conﬁdence intervals (CI). Each measure was weighted according to the number of patients
affected. The weighted-summary proportion was calculated by the Freeman–Tukey trans-
formation [ 23]. Heterogeneity among the studies was assessed using 2and I2statistics.
I2< 50% indicated acceptable heterogeneity, and, therefore, the ﬁxed-effects model was
used; otherwise, the random-effects model was performed. In addition, a comparison of
weighted proportions was performed to compare the prevalence rates of positive margin
and hemorrhage between BOT and tonsil. Finally, Egger’s tests with funnel plots were per- Cancers 2022 ,14, 3837 4 of 17
formed to further assess the risk of publication bias [ 24,25]. In a funnel plot, the treatment
effect is plotted on the horizontal axis, and the standard error is plotted on the vertical
axis. The vertical line represents the summary estimated and is derived using a ﬁxed-effect
meta-analysis. Two diagonal lines represent (pseudo) 95% conﬁdence limits (effect 
1.96 SE) around the summary effect for each standard error on the vertical axis. These show
the expected distribution of studies in the absence of heterogeneity or selection bias. In
the absence of heterogeneity, 95% of the studies should lie within the funnel deﬁned by
these diagonal lines. Potential publication bias was evaluated by a visual inspection of
the funnel plot (as bias results in asymmetry of the funnel plot), and Egger’s test, which
statistically examines this asymmetry. A p-value of <0.05 was considered to indicate a
statistically signiﬁcant difference for all the statistical tests.
3. Results
3.1. Search Results and Study Characteristics
The search strategies yielded 1386 unique articles, with title and abstract screening
excluding 1036 articles. A full-text review of the remaining studies excluded 322 articles,
leaving 28 remaining articles for inclusion in the ﬁnal data extraction and analysis. Figure 1

 Freeman–Tukey  transformation  [23]. Heterogeneity  among the studies was assessed  us‐
ing χ2 and I2 statistics.  I2 < 50% indicated  acceptable  heterogeneity,  and, therefore,  the 
fixed‐effects model was used; otherwise,  the random‐effects model was performed.  In ad‐
dition, a comparison  of weighted  proportions  was performed  to compare  the prevalence  
rates of positive margin and hemorrhage  between BOT and tonsil. Finally, Egger’s tests 
with funnel plots were performed  to further assess the risk of publication  bias [24,25]. In 
a funnel plot, the treatment  effect is plotted on the horizontal  axis, and the standard  error 
is plotted on the vertical axis. The vertical line represents  the summary  estimated  and is 
derived using a fixed‐effect meta‐analysis.  Two diagonal  lines represent  (pseudo)  95% 
confidence  limits (effect ± 1.96 SE) around the summary  effect for each standard  error on 
the vertical axis. These show the expected  distribution  of studies in the absence of hetero‐
geneity or selection  bias. In the absence of heterogeneity,  95% of the studies should lie 
within the funnel defined by these diagonal  lines. Potential  publication  bias was evaluated  
by a visual inspection  of the funnel plot (as bias results in asymmetry  of the funnel plot), 
and Egger’s test, which statistically  examines  this asymmetry.  A p‐value of <0.05 was con‐
sidered to indicate a statistically  significant  difference  for all the statistical  tests.

A critical appraisal of the studies indicated an acceptably low risk of bias for the
majority of those that were included (Figure 2).
Potential sources of bias were most pronounced in bias in the selection of participants
and bias in the selection of the reported results. A funnel plot with Egger’s test sug-
gested little publication bias, as all the studies were within the funnel with no asymmetry
(0.4, 95% CI-1.0–1.8, p= 0.568) (Figure S1).

3.2. Patient Characteristics
A total of 2908 patients were included from all 28 studies (Table 1). The tonsillar
OPSCC group had 1769 patients, and the BOT OPSCC group had 1139 patients. All
patients’ mean and median age ranged from 54.0 years to 63.7 years, with most patients
being male (range 62.9% to 95.7%). Most included patients did not have advanced disease
(T3 and T4 range 0.0% to 26.1%), but there was a wide range of adjuvant radiotherapy
(0.0% to 100.0%) and chemoradiotherapy (0.0% to 100%). The mean and median follow-up
ranged from 10.5 to 48.4 months for the included studies.
3.3. Margin Status
A total of 12 studies included extractable data on margin status after resection using
TORS [ 12,26–36]. BOT OPSCC had a statistically signiﬁcant higher rate of positive margins
when compared to tonsillar OPSCC (28.1% [95% CI 15.1–43.3] vs. 7.5% [95% CI 3.3–13.3]).

A total of 2908 patients were included  from all 28 studies (Table 1). The tonsillar OP‐
SCC group had 1769 patients,  and the BOT OPSCC group had 1139 patients.  All patientsʹ 
mean and median age ranged from 54.0 years to 63.7 years, with most patients being male 
(range 62.9% to 95.7%). Most included  patients did not have advanced  disease (T3 and T4 
range 0.0% to 26.1%), but there was a wide range of adjuvant  radiotherapy  (0.0% to 
100.0%) and chemoradiotherapy  (0.0% to 100%). The mean and median follow‐up ranged 
from 10.5 to 48.4 months for the included  studies.

4. Discussion  
There is a paucity of literature  comparing  the postoperative  outcomes  after TORS by 
subsite, particularly  tonsil and BOT. Therefore,  we performed  this systematic  review and 
meta‐analysis to compare  the margin, recurrence,  and postoperative  hemorrhage  rates be‐
tween patients with tonsillar and BOT OPSCC. Notably,  patients with BOT OPSCC had 
higher rates of positive margins after TORS, but contrary to our initial hypothesis,  this did 
not translate  to a higher locoregional  or metastatic  recurrence  rate. Furthermore,  postop‐
erative hemorrhage  rates were not noted to be different  between these two subgroups  of 
patients undergoing  TORS. 
In our included  studies, patients with BOT OPSCC had a higher proportion  of posi‐
tive postoperative  margins compared  to patients with tonsillar OPSCC (28.1% vs. 7.5%). 
In OPSCC, the positive margin rate for all subsites after TORS has been cited as between 
16.9% and 21.2% [53–55]. The utility of TORS regarding  improvement  in margin status is 
inconsistent.  One systematic  review that combined  outcomes  from TORS, transoral  laser 
microsurgery  (TLM), and transoral  conventional  surgery found a lower positive margin 
rate of 7.8%, with the tonsil and BOT subsites not being factors in margin status [56]. How‐
ever, another retrospective  study of the National  Cancer Database  (NCDB) found that 
TORS was associated  with a lower likelihood  of positive margins for all sites compared  to 
non‐robotic procedures,  but not TLM [57]. When considering  outcomes  after TORS, an‐
other NCDB study by Hanna et al. found the rate of BOT OPSCC positive margins was 
higher than tonsillar OPSCC, but this was nonsignificant  [55]. Interestingly,  Hanna et al. 
and another more recent NCDB review from Oliver et al. found that high volume cancer 
centers reduced their positive margin rates by almost half compared  to low volume cen‐
ters (12.7% versus 21.9% and 11.2% to 19.3%) [55,58]. Furthermore,  Oliver et al. found that 
BOT positive margins were reduced by around 6% when comparing  rates from 2011 to 
2016 [58]. A systematic  review on TORS found that specific procedures  were more difficult 
due to the structural  components  of the robot, with BOT resections  being more likely to

4. Discussion
There is a paucity of literature comparing the postoperative outcomes after TORS
by subsite, particularly tonsil and BOT. Therefore, we performed this systematic review
and meta-analysis to compare the margin, recurrence, and postoperative hemorrhage rates
between patients with tonsillar and BOT OPSCC. Notably, patients with BOT OPSCC
had higher rates of positive margins after TORS, but contrary to our initial hypothesis,
this did not translate to a higher locoregional or metastatic recurrence rate. Furthermore,
postoperative hemorrhage rates were not noted to be different between these two subgroups
of patients undergoing TORS.
In our included studies, patients with BOT OPSCC had a higher proportion of positive
postoperative margins compared to patients with tonsillar OPSCC (28.1% vs. 7.5%). In
OPSCC, the positive margin rate for all subsites after TORS has been cited as between
16.9% and 21.2% [ 53–55]. The utility of TORS regarding improvement in margin status is
inconsistent. One systematic review that combined outcomes from TORS, transoral laser
microsurgery (TLM), and transoral conventional surgery found a lower positive margin
rate of 7.8%, with the tonsil and BOT subsites not being factors in margin status [ 56].
However, another retrospective study of the National Cancer Database (NCDB) found that
TORS was associated with a lower likelihood of positive margins for all sites compared
to non-robotic procedures, but not TLM [ 57]. When considering outcomes after TORS,
another NCDB study by Hanna et al. found the rate of BOT OPSCC positive margins
was higher than tonsillar OPSCC, but this was nonsigniﬁcant [ 55]. Interestingly, Hanna
et al. and another more recent NCDB review from Oliver et al. found that high volume
cancer centers reduced their positive margin rates by almost half compared to low volume
centers (12.7% versus 21.9% and 11.2% to 19.3%) [ 55,58]. Furthermore, Oliver et al. found
that BOT positive margins were reduced by around 6% when comparing rates from 2011
to 2016 [ 58]. A systematic review on TORS found that speciﬁc procedures were more
difﬁcult due to the structural components of the robot, with BOT resections being more
likely to undergo conversion to an open approach [ 59]. As positive margin status is a strong
consideration for adjuvant therapy and increased treatment burden, surgeons must be able
to counsel patients appropriately on the risks after TORS. Our ﬁndings suggest that it may
be more challenging to completely clear all margins in BOT OPSCC resections, but the
literature suggests that high volume centers can signiﬁcantly reduce their positive margin
rate through more experience.
Even though BOT OPSCC had higher rates of positive margins, our study did not show
increased odds of locoregional or metastatic recurrence for BOT OPSCC when compared to
tonsillar OPSCC. In surgical oncological care, positive postoperative margins have been
widely accepted as a prognostic factor for increased locoregional recurrence [ 60]. This has
been endorsed in numerous studies of OPSCC, with patients who had ﬁnal positive mar-
gins experiencing reduced disease-speciﬁc survival, recurrence-free survival, and overall
survival [ 39,61–64]. However, all of these studies did not report HPV tumor status, which
has been shown to be a crucial delineator when considering OPSCC outcomes [ 48]. Iyer
et al. compared disease-speciﬁc survival based on margin status stratiﬁed by HPV positiv-
ity [65]. While patients with positive margins had worse survival in HPV-negative cases,
there was no difference in survival based on ﬁnal margins in HPV-positive patients [ 65].
A more recent but smaller study endorsed these ﬁndings of margin status not being a
predictive factor in p16 positive tumors [ 18]. These ﬁndings have been further conﬁrmed
by Carey et al., who could not ﬁnd any pathological features associated with locoregional
recurrence in p16 positive OPSCC [ 38]. However, a recent NCBD did endorse positive
margin status as a statistically signiﬁcant prognosticator for risk of death in the univari-
ate analysis, but these ﬁndings did not persist into the multivariate analysis [ 66]. When
considering outcomes by subsite, the current literature is minimal. Only one retrospective
review comparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy found BOT OPSCC to have a higher
metastatic recurrence rate, while having similar locoregional control compared to tonsillar
OPSCC [ 67]. As our included patients had a pooled proportion of 92.3% p16/HPV-positive Cancers 2022 ,14, 3837 11 of 17
malignancies, this study endorses the current literature and deintensiﬁcation trends that
the increased positive margins in BOT tumors may not be an essential variable when
considering locoregional and metastatic recurrence.
Regarding rates of postoperative hemorrhage, our study did not ﬁnd any statistical
differences between tonsillar and BOT OPSCC (10.7% and 8.8%). These rates are similar to
postoperative hemorrhage in all cases after TORS, which is reported to be between 1.5% and
13.0% [ 68–72]. As postoperative hemorrhage after TORS can cause mortality, decreasing
the risk factors for this complication is crucial to improving surgical care [ 71]. The literature
is limited in directly comparing hemorrhage rates between tonsil and BOT. One study
endorsed no differences in both univariate and multivariate analyses [ 73], but two other
studies, including one national database, found that tonsillar OPSCC had higher odds of
experiencing postoperative hemorrhage when compared to BOT [ 74,75]. Neither study had
complete explanations for why tonsillar OPSCC had higher hemorrhage rates but argued
that it could be due to an increased likelihood that T3 or T4 tumors of the tonsils were being
removed with TORS, while T3 and T4 BOT OPSCC would almost exclusively undergo
an open approach [ 74,75]. Since T3 and T4 tumors involve the larger arteries around
the tonsillar fossa, theoretically, there could be a higher chance of hemorrhage [ 74,75].
One of these studies felt that it was more multifactorial secondary to platelet dysfunction,
antithrombotic medications, or hepatic insufﬁciencies [ 75]. While our study endorsed
no differences, the BOT conﬁdence interval was very wide (1.5% to 21.3%), secondary
to only three studies with extractable data. Therefore, we feel that this ﬁnding should
be interpreted with caution and should be used as a hypothesis-generating ﬁnding for
future research.
The most signiﬁcant limitation of this study was the lack of subgroup analyses. As
most of the studies included in this systematic review looked at other outcomes of TORS
after OPSCC, only a few direct comparisons of tonsillar versus BOT OPSCC could be ex-
tracted. Therefore, unfortunately, we could not separate patients by their adjuvant therapy
status for each subsite. As radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy has been supported for
tumors with positive margins [ 76,77], these treatments may have inﬂuenced the nonsigniﬁ-
cant differences in locoregional and distant control seen between tonsillar and BOT OPSCC,
even though BOT OPSCC had higher rates of positive margins. Only two studies reported
differences in adjuvant therapy between subsites, with Fradet et al. ﬁnding no differences
in the rate of adjuvant therapy, whereas Persky et al. found that BOT OPSCC underwent
more chemoradiation secondary to more positive margins [ 12,40]. In looking at all the
subsites combined, a few studies have endorsed TORS with adjuvant therapy to be supe-
rior to TORS alone, particularly when considering locoregional control [ 16,38]. However,
the literature is not consistent, with two studies showing excellent locoregional (3.0% to
3.3%) and distant control (0.0% to 8.4%) in patients with HPV-positive OPSCC undergoing
single modality TORS therapy, regardless of margin status [ 78,79]. Furthermore, more
studies have shown that both negative margin status and adjuvant therapy do not improve
recurrence and survival and that salvage therapy can be just as effective for those patients
with recurrences [ 39,42,43,80]. Nichols et al. even said that, because of the high survival
rate in HPV OPSCC after TORS, margins and adjuvant therapy most likely do not con-
tribute to overall outcomes. As adjuvant radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy have been
shown to signiﬁcantly worsen quality of life compared to TORS [ 81,82], more research is
needed to fully understand the inﬂuence of adjuvant therapy on recurrence in OPSCC with
positive margins.
Furthermore, we could not separate patients with more signiﬁcant disease, such as
T3 and T4 staging, an elevated Charlson comorbidity index, or extranodal extension. In
particular, for the postoperative hemorrhage analysis, we could not separate patients on
anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications, which have shown to be a signiﬁcant risk
factor for post-TORS hemorrhage [ 71,74]. Furthermore, this study was limited by the
heterogeneity between studies. Some studies reported on their ﬁrst implementations of
TORS at their institution, while others performed recent retrospective reviews after a decade Cancers 2022 ,14, 3837 12 of 17
of use. As increased experience with TORS can decrease postoperative positive margins,
the length of institutional experience with TORS may have been a confounding factor in
these analyses [ 58]. Moreover, while most studies included upfront TORS for OPSCC,
some included salvage procedures that were unable to be factored out of the analysis,
therefore, potentially elevating rates of positive margin, recurrence, and hemorrhage for
that particular study. In addition, positive margins were not classiﬁed uniformly, with
some studies using the typical 5 mm mark for clear margins, while others classiﬁed 2 mm
or close margins as clear. Follow-up varied signiﬁcantly with the studies, with some studies
only including an average of ten months of follow-up, with others including up to forty
months. This factor could decrease the studies’ measurement of locoregional or metastatic
recurrence with short follow-up compared to those with extensive follow-up. Lastly, the
fact that all studies were retrospective case series limits how this analysis translates to
the general population. Therefore, a prospective observational trial using standardized
deﬁnitions of a positive margin and follow-up would better elucidate differences in tonsillar
and BOT OPSCC outcomes after TORS.
5. Conclusions
In this systematic review comparing tonsillar and BOT OPSCC, a higher rate of positive
margins was seen in BOT OPSCC. However, there was no difference in the locoregional and
metastatic recurrence rates between these subsites. In addition, postoperative hemorrhage
rates did not statistically differ. High heterogeneity between the studies limited the ability
to perform clinically relevant subgroup analyses to identify which particular tonsillar or
BOT OPSCC patients would be at a higher risk of these poor outcomes. Therefore, future
research to identify these risk factors in patients with each tonsillar and BOT OPSCC is
warranted to improve the utility of TORS and oncological care.
