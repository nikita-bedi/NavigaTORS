Summary
The incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is rising in contrast to the decreasing incidence of carcinomas in other 
subsites of the head and neck, in spite of the reduced prevalence of smoking. Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, and in particular 
type 16 (HPV-16), is now recognized as a significant player in the onset of HPV positive OPSCC, with different epidemiological, clinical, 
anatomical, radiological, behavioural, biological and prognostic characteristics from HPV negative OPSCC. Indeed, the only subsite in 
the head and neck with a demonstrated aetiological viral link is, at present, the oropharynx. These observations lead to questions regarding 
management choices for patients based on tumour HPV status with important consequences on treatment, and on the role of vaccines and targeted therapy over the upcoming years.

L’incidenza del carcinoma spinocellulare dell’orofaringe (OPSCC) è in aumento in contrasto con la diminuzione dell’incidenza di carci-
nomi in altre sedi del distretto cervico-facciale, nonostante la ridotta prevalenza del fumo. L’infezione da Papilloma Virus Umano (HPV), 
in particolare di tipo 16 (HPV 16), è ora riconosciuto come un importante fattore nell’insorgenza di HPV OPSCC positivo, con diverse 
caratteristiche radiologiche, epidemiologiche, cliniche, anatomiche, biologiche e prognostiche rispetto all’HPV OPSCC negativo. In effetti l’unica sede del distretto cervico-facciale con un collegamento virale eziologico dimostrato è, attualmente, l’orofaringe. Queste osserva-
zioni portano a domande riguardanti le scelte di gestione per i pazienti in base allo stato del tumore HPV con importanti conseguenze sul 
trattamento e sul ruolo dei vaccini e terapia mirata per i prossimi anni.

Introduction
head and neck cancer, which includes tumours that arise 
from the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, hypopharynx 
and sinonasal tract, represents a serious health care prob-
lem in many parts of the world, and ranks as the sixth most 
common cancer worldwide 1. These tumours are linked by 
common characteristics including a male predominant ap-pearance in the 5-6th decade of life, a strong aetiological 
link with prior tobacco, alcohol use or betel nut chew-
ing
 2, and a histopathological resemblance 3. About 90% 
of head and neck cancers are squamous cell carcinomas (hnSCC).The estimated annual burden of hnSCC is approximately 650,555 incident cases and approximately 300,000 result-
ant deaths
 4 5. it is considered the sixth leading cause of 
cancer mortality and oropharyngeal squamous cell carci-
noma (oPSCC) accounts for approximately 50,000 inci-
dent cases, which is low in comparison with other head 
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnSCC) 5 6.
Multiple studies have demonstrated that the incidence of hnSCC has remained stable or even declined in the late 
1980s, due to the gradual decrease in smoking and alco-
hol which are the primary risk factors for these cancers
 2. 
Despite this, the incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma with different characteristics, particularly  S. Elrefaey et al.300in the base of the tongue and tonsil subsites, has increased 
by 2-3% annually during 1973-2001, and then by 5.22% 
annually from 2000 to 2004 in the USA 7. Similar trends 
have been noted in other countries. in particular, one study 
suggests that the annual number of hPV-associated oro-pharyngeal cancers in the United States will overtake the incidence of invasive cervical cancer cases in the United 
States by 2020
 8. There is also a discrepancy in incidence 
of oPSCC between developed and developing countries 
of oropharyngeal cancer 9.
The developing world has a relatively low proportion of oPSCC (1-10% of hnSCCs), which appears to remain 
stable (or even to decrease) over time, while the incidence 
of hnSCC has steadily increased in most countries
 4 10.
The developed world features a relatively high and vari-able proportion of oPSCCs (15-30% of hnSCC). For ex-
ample, a central belt of European countries has the highest 
oPSCC proportions in the developed world (up to 30% 
of hnSCCs) with the remainder of Europe being charac-
terised by slightly lower oPSCC proportions, while the overall hnSCCs incidence has remained stable or has even shown a declining trend over the same period
 4 11 12. 
These demographic data prompted researchers to search for further risk factors contributing to the incidence of 
oPSCC.
The impact of HPV as a risk factor  
for OPSCC
Most studies have demonstrated that features tobacco and 
alcohol consumption are major, common risk factors for hnSCC, but over the last 10-15 years hPV infection has 
been increasingly recognised as a major aetiological fac-tor for a subset of hnSCCs
 7-10, including mostly oPSCC. 
hPV infection in the aetiology of oPSCC was first shown by gillison et al.
 13; numerous case series studies conduct-
ed in the late 1990s and 2000s evaluated the prevalence 
hPV infection in oropharyngeal cancer using molecular 
techniques such as PCr and in situ hybridisation 8 14 15. in-
deed, over the last five years it has become increasingly clear that hPV plays a pathogenic role in this subset of 
head and neck cancers, with distinct epidemiologic, clini-
cal and molecular characteristics. These findings have created new opportunities for improved therapy and pri-mary prevention for these hnSCCs
 16.
At present, it should be clear that the only subsite in the head and neck with a demonstrated role for hPV infection 
in the aetiology of cancer is the oropharynx, as noted in 
the most important report by gillison et  al.
  13 and con-
firmed by Stransky et al. in 2011 13 17.
From a biological point of view, hPV is a Dn A onco-
virus and is epitheliotropic. There are over 120 differ -
ent hPV subtypes, including the low-risk types such as hPV 6 and hPV 11, responsible for benign proliferation of epithelium, and the high-risk oncogenic types hPV 16 and hPV 18 which are both well-established initiators of 
over 90% of cervical cancers, 70% of anogenital cancers, 
5% of non-oropharyngeal SCC
  17 and 20-72% of oP-
SCC 2 4 12 17. The oncogenic nature of high risk hPVs is 
due to the immortalising and transforming properties of 
hPV oncoproteins E6 and E7, which target the p53 and prB tumour suppressor pathways, respectively, rendering infected cells susceptible to mutations and cancer forma-tion
 18 19. Since the majority of hPV-hnSCCs are oPSCC, 
we will mainly discuss oPSCC.
Classification of oropharyngeal cancer 
according to HPV
According to the national Comprehensive Cancer net-
work (nCCn) 20 guidelines, ‘hPV testing is recommend-
ed for all oropharyngeal tumours’. in addition, according 
to the US national Cancer institute (nCi) 21 and Cancer 
Therapy Evaluation Programme (CTEP)  22, hPV status 
must be included as a stratification factor for trials includ-
ing oropharynx cancer patients. Much evidence suggests 
that hPV-positive and hPV-negative oPSCCs represent distinct subgroups of oPSCC, each with unique epide-
miological and biological profiles
 4 5 17 21 23-27.
Differences between HPV positive  
and HPV negative OPSCCs
Epidemiological factors
hPV-positive patients tend to be younger with a median 
age of diagnosis of 54 years, less exposure to tobacco 
and alcohol  28-30, and higher socioeconomic status and 
education  31. hPV positivity is less frequent in blacks 
than in Caucasians (4% of hnSCC in blacks vs. 34% in 
whites) 32, with a three fold higher incidence in males than 
females 28 33 34.
As in cervical cancer, oral hPV infection appears to be a sexually-acquired disease. Although the natural history 
of oral hPV infection is not well defined, D’Souza and 
colleagues recently showed in a case-control study that a 
high (≥ 26) number of lifetime vaginal-sex partners and 
6 or more lifetime oral-sex partners were associated with an increased risk of oPSCC [odd ratio (or) 3.1 and 3.4, 
respectively]
 35. An increased risk of hPV-associated oP-
SCC in female patients with a history of hPV-associated anogenital cancers and their male partners is also con-
sistent with hPV transmission to the oropharyngeal cav-ity
 36 37. The recent increased incidence of this disease may 
thus reflect societal changes in sexual behaviour that have occurred over time in the developed world
 38 39.
An important point to mention is that there is no clear case-control study addressing the evidence for hPV prior 
to development of oPSCC (i.e. temporal association), 
with the exception of a Scandinavian study by Mork et al.  HPV in oropharyngeal cancer301which showed that the presence of hPV 16 l1 antibod-
ies in pre-diagnostic serum samples was associated with a 14.4-fold increased risk of oropharyngeal cancer. impor -
tantly, the presence of hPV 16 antibodies preceded oro-pharyngeal cancers by more than 10 years, underscoring a temporal association. These data confirmed that oral hPV infection increases the risk of developing oPSSC
 40.
lastly, it is possible that in addition hPV infection, other risk factors or cofactors such as genetic susceptibility or nutritional factors or tobacco and alcohol interaction have an important role in cancer onset. There is an objective need for more analytic epidemiological studies in males and females diagnosed with hPV positive oropharyngeal cancer younger than 50 years of age
 40.
Anatomical sitesSeveral studies have noted an increased incidence of hPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers, especially tonsil-lar and tongue cancer. For example, in the USA they have risen by 3.9% and 2.1% among men and women, respec-tively, in the age group from 20 to 44 years, between 1973 and 2004
 2 41. Similar patterns have been noted in Sweden 
for tonsillar cancer which rose 2.9-fold between 1970 and 2001, increasing by 2.6% per year in men and 1.1% in women
 11 42.
The preference of hPV for the oropharynx is unexplained, but may be related to the unique presence of transitional mucosa in the oropharynx, predominantly found in the tonsillar tissue and which shows histological similarities to the cervical mucosa
 2 11. Another possibility lies within 
the genetic features of hPV 16, which accounts for more 
than 90-95% of all hPV associated oropharyngeal can-cers, as it may facilitate survival in the tonsillar crypt epithelium
 43 44. it is also possible that the invagination of 
the mucosal surface of the tonsil may favour virus capture and maintenance by promoting its access to basal cells (the only dividing cells in the epithelium)
 45. if this is true, 
tonsillar tissue could be a reservoir for hPV in the upper aerodigestive tract. This view is partly supported by the fact that when oral samples are collected by oral rinse, the detection rate of hPV is much higher than with swabs. Finally, the persistence of hPV in tonsillar tissue might be of importance in the immune response to hPV
 46.
Biological profilesrecent global genomic screening studies searching for a biological distinction among hPV-positive and negative oPSCC have shown that hPV-induced carcinogenesis has a clear impact on the acquisition and maintenance of spe-cific chromosomal gains and losses within tumour cells, in which oPSCCs with transcriptionally active hPV-DnA are characterised by occasional chromosomal loss/
allelic imbalance
 47. Conversely, those lacking hPV-Dn A 
are characterised by gross deletions that involve entire or large parts of chromosomal arms
 32 48.Furthermore, ploidy studies have confirmed that hPV-
positive tonsillar cancers feature a lower number of chro-mosomal alterations compared to their hPV-negative 
counterparts
 49 50.
The biology of hPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer is typified by p53 degradation, retinoblastoma protein (rB) 
down-regulation and p16 up-regulation. By contrast, to-bacco-related oropharyngeal cancer is characterised by p53 mutations, down-regulation of p16 and rB up-reg-
ulation
 45.
interestingly, recent studies observed an inverse correla-tion between the presence of hPV and p53 mutations
 17.
Clinical stage at presentation
Multiple studies have shown that hPV-positive tumours are more likely to present with early T stage (T1-T2)
 51 
and higher n stage (usually cystic and multilevel) 52, and 
have distinct histological features, such as moderate/poor tumour differentiation and non-keratinising or basaloid pathology
 14 19 51. The incidence of distant metastases was 
seen to be lower in patients with hPV positive tumours. 
Furthermore, metastases developed later and with a very 
different pattern from patients with hPV-negative tu-mours. hPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer had a 28% re-
duction in the risk of death and a 49% reduction in the risk 
of disease recurrence
 53. Secondary primary tumour (SPT) 
in patients with hPV-positive cancer is very rare, and has 
improved better survival rate compared to patients with 
hPV negative tumours 45.
Radiological imaging
recent studies have shown radiological difference be-
tween hPV-positive and hPV-negative oropharyngeal 
cancer. Specifically, hPV-positive carcinomas often had 
small or even occult primary lesions with well-defined 
borders and cystic nodal metastases, whereas hPV-nega-tive primaries more often had poorly defined borders and 
invasion of adjacent muscle
 52 54.
PrognosisSeveral studies have shown that patients with hPV-pos-
itive oropharyngeal cancer, identified through PCr, in situ hybridisation or p16 immunohistochemistry on tu-mour tissues, have a significantly improved overall and 
disease-free survival compared to patients with hPV-
negative oropharyngeal cancer patients
 29 53 55-61 (Table  i). 
This holds true even after adjustment for differences in favourable prognostic factors associated with hPV posi-tive patients (younger age, better performance status, fewer comorbidities, less smoking). Ang et al. reported 
that these prognostic factors explained only 10% of the 
observed survival differences between two subgroups
 29. 
however, other studies reported that survival rates im-proved among non-smoker hPV positive patients com- S. Elrefaey et al.302pared to smokers patients even in recurrent tumours, 
underscoring once again the benefits acquired from 
smoking cessation 62 63.
Why does hPV positive orophrangeal cancer have a bet-
ter prognosis?
1. hPV-positive tumours may harbour fewer or different 
genetic alterations, which can be associated with better response to therapy
 17 64.
2. hPV-positive tumours have higher radiosensitivity, 
probably due to intact apoptotic response to radia-
tion 58 65.
3. The absence of field cancerisation in hPV-positive tu-
mours 53.
4. immunologic response may be play a role in the im-
proved response to radio- and chemotherapy in hPV-positive tumours (due to the stimulation of immune 
response directed to viral specific tumour antigens
 66.
5. younger age, good performance status, fewer comor -
bidities of hPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer patients 
may also contribute to improved survival 67.
The impact of HPV on clinical management
The standard treatment for oPSCCs at present is mainly 
dependent on the stage of the disease and patient and cli-
nician preferences. Single-modality treatment, in the form 
of surgery or radiotherapy, is usually recommended for 
early (T1-T2, n0) disease. For advanced stage disease, 
standard treatments include chemoradiotherapy with or 
without neck dissection, or surgical resection with re-
construction and postoperative chemoradiotherapy, as required. These current standard methods of treatment 
appear to apply to both hPV positive and negative sub-
groups
 68 69.
1) Non-surgical treatment options for OPSCCsThe emergence of hPV-oPSCCs in younger patients 
with better prognosis and survival rates in comparison to 
non-hPV oPSCCs have prompted clinicians to address changes in the non-surgical management according to 
hPV status
 2.
Multiple studies  29  58-61  68-70 tackling this issue have con-
cluded that (Tables i, ii):
1. overall survival rates increase with hPV positive sta-
tus, low EgFr and high p16 72.2. Patients with hPV negative disease have a poorer 
prognosis, and therefore usually require more intensive 
treatment. Studies (TAX 324 61, Trog 02.02 59) have 
suggested that for patients with hPV Dn A-negative 
tumours, treatment intensification improves outcomes compared to standard treatment, but overall outcome is still poor.
3. Smoking cessation and strategies to target EgFr and Bcl-xl
 70 are important adjuncts in the treatment of oro-
pharyngeal cancer.
4. Achievement of acceptable cure rates with minimal long-term morbidity with hPV positive oropharyngeal 
cancer is possible.
All these data suggest that hPV status can be used in the 
clinical decision-making processes to select patients for 
less aggressive non-surgical treatment. Thus, assessing 
hPV presence is of utmost importance. This is especially 
true considering long-term outcomes of hPV-positive younger patients, since they are at risk of a lifetime com-
promised quality of life as a result of chronic toxicities due 
to chemoradiotherapy. p16 immunohistochemistry (ihC) 
is a current marker to detect hPV presence. however, it 
can be associated with a high rate of false positive/false 
negative responses, prompting the need for new surrogate 
markers for oral hPV infection. These concerns were also 
reported by rietbergen et al.
 71 and Bussu et al. 72. Thus, in 
clinical practice it is not recommended to rely on p16 ihC 
alone to screen for hPV positivity.
Currently, there are on-going oncological trials that at-
tempt to answer some questions regarding deintensifica-
tion of treatment (Table iii):
1. Can we use neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by re-
duced radiotherapy dose in hPV positive patients?
2. What is the intensity of adjuvant therapy required in p16-positive oropharynx cancer patients?
3. Can cetuximab provide selective radiosensitisation 
compared with cisplatin?
4. Should the volume treated be reduced by not adminis-
tering prophylactic radiotherapy to areas at risk of mi-
croscopic disease?
5. is it possible to reduce the dose of radiation therapy 
when given with standard doses of chemotherapy?
6. What is the exact role of immune activation in hPV 
positive patients?Table I. Selected studies reporting the association of HPV infection with oropharyngeal cancer prognosis.

proaches, especially transoral robotic surgery (T orS), 
have gained more favour by achieving the satisfactory 
oncological outcomes without compromising functional 
outcome 73 74. indeed, three-dimensional visualisation al-
lows the ability to manipulate 75 and perform reconstruc-
tion of the oropharynx without the need for mandibulot-omy and/or pharyngotomy, thus reducing the morbidity of extensive surgery
 76. it also facilitates safer exposure 
and resection of the primary tumour, thereby providing complete pathologic evaluation and impacting the use 
of clinically-established adjuvant therapies
 77. These in-
clude use of concurrent chemotherapy  78 and effective 
lower doses of radiotherapy, which contribute to a de-crease of swallowing dysfunction
 79. The postoperative 
target volume for radiation is typically smaller, and with 
modern techniques such as intensity modulated radio-
therapy (iMr T) this procedure can significantly reduce 
the dose delivered to uninvolved normal structures. in patients requiring postoperative concurrent chemoradia-
tion, this offers the potential to reduce the risk of late complications
 80.
The incorporation of T orS, not only to improve oncolog-
ic results but also to decrease the long-term toxicity risks caused by non-surgical strategies, is crucial for hPV posi-tive patients since they typically present at a younger age.
To date, there are few surgical trials investigating the 
role of T orS in hPV positive patients. For instance, 
Cohen et  al.
  81 found no differences in oncological out-
comes, overall survival or loco-regional control between 
hPV-positive and negative groups patients who under -
went T orS surgery stratified by hPV status. nonethe-
less, T orS surgery was suitable for both subgroups. The 
Mount Sinai group reported no differences in overall 
survival or loco-regional control in patients stratified by smoking status, with the assumption that patients without 
a smoking history are predominantly hPV positive
 82.
The failure to show statistically significant differences in hPV-positive and hPV-negative tumours in T orS sur -
gical trials for early T stage differences is unclear. it is 
possible that these studies were small and thus lack the 
statistical power to show survival differences, or that the 
survival advantage in hPV-positive tumours does not ap-
ply to early T-stage tumours that are surgically resected. 
lastly, one may argue that hPV-negative tumours are less 
radio-responsive, and surgical resection provides better 
prognosis in the cohort being studied
 83.
new multi-institutional studies are needed to confirm the 
exact impact of T orS on the quality of life and survival 
outcomes of hPV negative and positive oPSCC patients.
Future directions in HPV-positive OPSCCs
hPV-induced carcinogenesis has been extensively stud-ied in the most widely accepted hPV-related malignancy, namely cervical cancer. hPV-associated cancers continu-
ously express the hPV E6 and E7 viral oncogenes even 
during advanced stages, and repression of viral oncogene expression can prevent growth or survival of cervical can-
cer cells
 84. These findings raise the possibility that even 
late-stage hPV-associated cancers can be treated through hPV-targeted approaches with drugs that interfere with 
the expression or function of the viral oncoproteins or with therapeutic vaccines that elicit a cytolytic immune 
response in cells expressing these oncoproteins.
Vaccination
The world has greatly benefited from vaccine programmes 
in controlling the morbidity and mortality of infectious diseases. hepatitis B virus (hBV) vaccine, developed for 
the prevention of hepatitis B virus infection, is considered 
the first vaccine against a major human cancer, hepatocel-lular carcinoma
 85. recently, a prophylactic hPV vaccine 
has been included in national immunisation programmes of most developed countries with the hope of also be-ing included in developing countries within the next few 
years, with the goal of preventing cervical and other non-
cervical hPV related cancers
 86.
Two FDA-approved hPV prophylactic vaccines are 
currently available  87. The quadrivalent vaccine was ini-
tially approved in the US in 2006, and is composed of 
four hPV type-specific virus-like particles (VlPs) from 
the major capsid protein l1 of hPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18, combined with aluminium phosphate adjuvant. These 
are the most common hPV types found in 70% of cer -
vical cancers and 90% of non-cervical cancers
 87 88. The 
bivalent hPV vaccine, approved in 2009, is composed of two hPV types, 16 and 18, which cause 70% of cervical 
cancers
  86. The efficacy of the quadrivalent vaccine was 
100% in preventing hPV 16 and 18 related cervical in-
traepithelial neoplasia (Cin) grades 2/3 and vulvar and 
vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (Vin) 2/3, and 98.9% in preventing hPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 related genital warts
 89. 
The bivalent vaccine is 98.1% efficacious in hPV 16 and 
18 related Cin 2/3 prevention 90.
The Advisory Committee on immunization Practices (ACiP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion (CDC) recommends
 88 90 91:
•	 routine	 vaccination	 of	girls	aged	11	or	12	years	that	can	
be started at 9 years of age;
•	 catch-up	vaccination	for	females	aged	13-26	years;•	 routine	vaccination	of	boys	aged	11	or	12	years;
•	 routine	 vaccination	 recommended	 for	both	men	who	
have sex with men (MSM) and immunocompromised individuals aged 22 through 26 years;
•	 men	aged	13	to	21	years	who	were	not	previously	 vac-
cinated;
•	 men	aged	22	to	26	years	may	also	receive	the	vaccine;
•	 can	be	given	to	lactating	 women,	patients	with	minor	 HPV in oropharyngeal cancer305acute illnesses and women with equivocal or abnormal 
Pap test.
hPV vaccine should be delivered through a series of 3 intramuscular injections over a 6-month period of time, 
at 0, 2 and 6 months for the quadrivalent vaccine and 0, 1 and 6 months for the bivalent one
  89, inducing strong 
immune memory with persistent antibody up to 6.4 years (bivalent) and up to 9.5 years (hPV 16 VlP used in quad-rivalent) thus entailing long-term duration of protection 
against infections caused by pathogenic hPVs and their 
disease sequelae
 92.
The entrance of males into vaccination programmes is primarily due to the estimation of 7,500 cases of hPV-related cancer, primarily head and neck and anal can-
cer, which occur in men each year in the United States 
alone
 93. Furthermore, the rates of anal cancer in homosex-
ual males are extremely high, and thus vaccination may 
contribute in immunisation with subsequent reduction of 
hPV sexual transmission.in the future, the currently available vaccines may also 
show promising results on preventing hPV-associated 
oPSCC caused by hPV 16, and longitudinal studies com-paring the incidence of disease before and after the intro-
duction of the vaccine may clarify this issue.
Unfortunately, the prophylactic vaccine is not effective on established infections and cancer lesions, so the study of 
a therapeutic hPV vaccine to treat hPV-associated cancer 
remains an area of crucial importance
 94.
Different immunotherapeutic vaccines targeting E7 and/
or E6 have been developed over the last decade including 
peptide/protein, dendritic cell (DC), plasmid Dn A and 
viral vector-based therapies, but with limited success in 
preclinical and clinical phase studies 95 96. A recent italian 
study developed a promising therapeutic vaccine based on an integrase defective lentiviral vector (iDl V) to de-
liver a mutated non-oncogenic form of the hPV  16 E7 
protein, considered as a tumour specific antigen for im-
munotherapy of hPV-associated cervical cancer, fused to 
calreticulin (Cr T), a protein that is able to activate natu-
ral killer T cells (nKTs). A single intramuscular injection 
prevented tumour growth in 90% of early stage tumour-
bearing mice, without adjuvants and/or drug treatments. These promising results may suggest that a safe antican-
cer immunotherapeutic vaccine may be available in the 
future for human use
 94.
Targeted therapies
Evaluation of epithelial growth factor receptor (EgFr)-targeted therapies in hnSCC patients have been based 
on the observation that EgFr is highly expressed in hn-
SCC, and its over-expression has been associated with reduced survival in several studies
 97. For clinical use, Eg-
Fr can be targeted either by antibodies recognising the ligand-binding domain of EgFr or by EgrF tyrosine ki-nase inhibitors (TKis). Cetuximab is a humanised mouse anti-EgFr igg1 monoclonal antibody, offering improved 
loco-regional control and overall survival in locally-ad-
vanced hnSCC in combination with radiotherapy
 98.
other humanised anti-EgFr antibodies such a panitu-
mumab or zalutumumab are currently being evaluated in 
phase ii/iii clinical trials and may evolve as alternatives 
to cetuximab 99. Additional prospective clinical trials are 
on-going to assess the value of cetuximab in management 
of hPV-positive oPSCCs.
Conclusions
To date, the available data corroborate some well-estab-
lished concepts: oropharynx tumours have been steadily increasing over the last 20 years compared to other can-
cers of the head and neck worldwide, particularly in West-
ern countries. SEEr data suggest that about 18% of all head and neck carcinomas in the USA were located in the 
oropharynx in 1973, compared to 31% of such squamous 
cell tumours in 2004. Similarly, in Sweden, the proportion 
of oropharyngeal cancers hPV positive has steadily in-
creased, from 23% in the 1970s to 57% in the 1990s, and as high as 93% in 2007. These data indicate that hPV is 
now the primary cause of tonsillar cancer in north Amer -
ica and Europe.The biology of hPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer is 
characterised by p53 degradation, retinoblastoma rB 
pathway inactivation and p16 up-regulation. in contrast, tobacco-related oropharyngeal cancer is characterised 
by p53 mutation and down-regulation of CDKn2A (en-
coding p16ink4A). hPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer 
seems to be more responsive to chemotherapy and radia-
tion than hPV-negative disease.The choice of the best viral detection method in tumours 
is a matter of controversy, and both in-situ hybridisation 
and PCr are commonly used; p16 ihC is also being used to detect hPV infection, but with unreliable results
 71 72. 
Thus, there is clearly a need for new surrogate markers for 
hPV infection to give patients the best treatment strate-
gies.The presence of hPV 16 can also be thought of as a prog-
nostic marker for enhanced overall and disease-free sur -
vival, but its use as a predictive marker has not yet been 
proven. Many questions about the natural history of oral 
hPV infection are still under investigation.
regarding disease management, based on the present in-formation, we can consider hPV-positive oropharyngeal 
cancer as a distinct subset of hnSCC with a more favour -
able outcome. Patients with hPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer are typically young and in good health. in future 
clinical trials, cancer centres should stratify head and neck patients by hPV status. regardless of treatment 
modality, an opportunity now exists to investigate less in-
tense treatment strategies that do not compromise survival  S. Elrefaey et al.306outcomes, but lower the risk of fatal side effects. Thus, 
providing a high level quality of life with the fewest treat-ment complications are important considerations. Poten-tial long-term side effects of concurrent chemoradiation include dysphagia, xerostomia, feeding-tube dependency from fibrosis and scarring of the pharyngeal muscles, 
chronic aspiration and chronic fatigue.
however, we must always emphasise that the best cure against cancer is prevention, especially in those malig-nancies in which the main pathogenic agent is known. Finally, the authors wish to suggest reader to consult two very recent and excellent reviews: “new insights into human papillomavirus-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma”

virus (hPV) in head and neck region: review of litera-ture
