== MEDICATIONS == 
--Your discharge instructions contain a detailed list of all the medications you should (and should not) take. Please read this list over carefully, and don't hesitate to ask if there are any questions BEFORE you leave the hospital.  
--You will usually need pain medicine for 5 to 15 days after surgery. The pain might initially get better and then get worse around the 3rd-5th day after surgery. After that, we expect that your pain will get better and you can start using just tylenol for pain control. 
--You may use tylenol (acetaminophen) if it adequately controls your pain. Please do not take more than 4 g of acetaminophen within a 24 hour period. Please note that norco, percocet, and hycet contain acetaminophen.
--Do NOT take NSAIDs until given the okay by your surgeon.
--Any medications we are prescribing will be sent to your pharmacy directly through our electronic system.  You should have received these prescriptions at your preoperative visit and picked them up prior to surgery; if not, please let your nurse know. Please confirm we sent them to the correct pharmacy location with your nurse.
--Please take a stool softener (e.g. Colace or Miralax) while you are taking narcotic pain medications to prevent constipation. We have prescribed you a stool softener but you can purchase it over-the-counter if it is cheaper to do so. Do not drive while taking any muscle relaxants or narcotics. 
--We will not be prescribing your home medications.  Please follow-up with your primary care provider for your other prescriptions. Please schedule a follow-up appointment with your primary care provider regarding changes to any other medications you should be taking. 
--If you are taking any blood thinners (e.g. aspirin, plavix, eliquis) you can continue them on postoperative day #14. 

==DIET==
--Drinking liquids is vital to your recovery
--For the first two weeks after surgery please stay on a soft food diet (e.g. smoothies, mashed potatoes, and ice cream, and pudding). Thereafter you can go back to a regular diet.

Bleeding: Blood tinged drooling is common.  If profuse bleeding call 911.  
If more than a teaspoon of blood you should be seen immediately at Stanford or the closest emergency room for evaluation.
Position yourself so that blood comes out the mouth instead of down the throat.

--Please be very careful in cleaning your mouth until you see your surgeon next. Please continue just as you were doing in the hospital. 
--Please continue to rinse your mouth two times a day with peridex
--You can gently brush your teeth with a soft child's toothbrush

Please continue to use the following for rinsing your mouth. Make sure you rinse the surgical incision sites with the syringe that you were given as you left the hospital while in bands, then swish and spit at least 2-3 times a day as well as after meals.
Baking soda and salt mix:
