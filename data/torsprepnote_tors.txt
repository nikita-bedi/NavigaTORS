We had a lengthy discussion regarding TORS (Transoral Robotic Surgery) in hopes to identity the primary tumor.
 
I also discussed potential complications and risks as well as the benefits particular to this transoral endoscopic H&N surgical procedure.   
?	Taste changes / oral injury: injury to the mouth and post-operative dysgeusia (taste changes) are possible, due to the use of oral retractors. Sometime, there is residual tongue numbness or tingling. 
?	Bleeding: The risk of bleeding was also discussed in detail.  Based on longitudinal studies, the risk of serious bleeding is between 5% and 10% and catastrophic bleeding is less than 1%. The greatest risk of bleeding with TORS is between post op day 10-14, and thus it is important to abstain from NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, etc.) or blood thinners (aspirin, Eliquis, Xarelto, heparin, lovenox, etc) for at least 14 days following surgery.
?	Swallowing dysfunction: there may be significant short-term or even long-term swallowing dysfunction. 
?	Speech impairment:  Speech impairment may be temporary or permanent depending on the site of surgery.  Rehabilitation with the help of a speech and language pathologist improves both speech and swallowing functions.
?	Feeding tube: We also discussed the need for possible nasogastric feeding tube in the short term, for 1-2 weeks, or even a longer term, up to 3-4 weeks.  Speech and swallowing problems are expected and may last for weeks to months.  A feeding tube is placed through the nose to help with nutrition while waiting for reasonable return of swallowing mechanism. 
?	Tracheostomy: As well, the possible role for emergency tracheotomy or preventative tracheostomy was discussed in detail. Rarely, tracheostomy tube placement may be necessary if aspiration or breathing will be an issue.  Rarely do feeding and tracheostomy tubes become permanent.
