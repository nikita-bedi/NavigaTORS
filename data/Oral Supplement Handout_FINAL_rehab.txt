Any-Day Smoothie  
• ½ to 1 cup liquid base (milk, soy, or nut milk beverage, or 100%  juice)  
• ¼ cup each of  2 to 3 types of frozen berries or ½ fresh apple or pear or other fruit  
• ½ banana (optional)  
• 1 to 2 teaspoons ground flax seeds, hemp seeds, or chia seeds (optional)  
• ½ cup organic Greek yogurt or 4 oz soft or silken tofu  
• Handful of fresh spinach, kale, chard, cucumber, etc. for an extra serving of vegetables  
Blend ingredients in a blender  to desired consistency.  You may need more or less liquid 
to make the mixture blend. Using  frozen fruit instead of fresh will make  a thicker smoothie.
