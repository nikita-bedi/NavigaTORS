What is a Modified Barium Swallow Study (MBSS)? A modified barium swallow study is a radiologic examination of swallowing function that uses a video x-ray. The exam is performed in conjunction with a Radiologist and a Speech Language Pathologist, who specializes in the evaluation and treatment of swallowing disorders. During the test, you will be given different foods and liquids to chew and swallow and video x-ray images will be taken as the food passes through your mouth and throat. The test will help to figure out why you are having issues with your throat, including pain, discomfort, coughing, or the feeling of something being stuck.
