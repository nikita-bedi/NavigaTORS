High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is now recognised as the principal cause of the increasing incidence rates of
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) in some parts of the world. The primary risk factor for developing HPV-relatedOPSCC is oral HPV-infection and the majority of oral HPV-infections are acquired by oral sex. Progression into an OPSCC includespersistent infection with evasion of immune response in the microenvironment, the activation of viral early genes (E6, E7) inbasal epithelial cells, the deregulation of cell cycle and the accumulation of chromosomal instability. Patients affected by HPV-related OPSCC tend to be younger and have better outcomes. This observation has lead current research to evaluate treatmentde-escalation options to reduce long-term associated morbidity. Moreover, a different molecular profile for HPV-related OPSCChas been described, opening new options for targeted therapy and immunotherapy approaches. This paper comprehensivelyreviews our accumulated knowledge regarding the role of HPV in OPSCC spanning from infection to cancer development,including its clinical diagnosis, management and preventive strategies.

Introduction
Since the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)
classiﬁed Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 as ‘oncogenic’ to a
number of cancer sites [ 1] our understanding of the molecular,
clinical and epidemiological aspects of oropharyngeal squa-mous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has dramatically improved. Atthe same time, the global burden of the disease has steadilyincreased and it has been predicted to surpass cervical cancer insome developed countries [ 2]. An examination of accumulated
knowledge regarding the HPV-related OPSCC disease thus far
is warranted.
Human papillomavirus
HPVs are small viruses containing a circular double-strandedDNA genome of /C248 kb organised into three major regions: (i) an
upstream regulatory region (URR) that is the origin of replicationand includes transcription factor-binding sites and controls gene
expression; (ii) an early region, encoding for six genes involvedin multiple functions including viral replication and cell trans-formation (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, E7), and (iii) a late region, encod-ing for the L1 and L2 capsid proteins which self-assemble to yieldthe virion [ 3]. The main functions of each gene are summarised
in Figure 1.
To date, more than 200 HPV genotypes have been identiﬁed
[3]. Mucosal HPV types have been categorised into ‘high-risk’
(HR) and ‘low-risk’ (LR) types according to their potential toinduce malignancy in the cervix. Twelve HR-HPV types areclassiﬁed as oncogenic by IARC (group 1: 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39,
45, 51, 52, 56, 58 and 59) [ 4]. Among the HR-HPV types
involved in head and neck carcinogenesis, HPV16 is by far themost common, with a prevalence over the 80% in OPSCC, fol-lowed by HPV18 (3%) [ 5–7]. Other genotypes have been also
reported in a smaller number of patients such as HPV33,HPV35 and HPV58 [5, 6, 8].

doi:10.1093/annonc/mdx304Published online 15 June 2017 Global burden and incidence trends
In 2007, the IARC concluded that there was sufﬁcient evidence
for the carcinogenic role of HPV16 in tumours of the orophar-ynx [ 1], and estimated that /C2431% of OPSCC cases were attrib-
uted to HPV [ 9] .T h i se s t i m a t e ,a sw e l la sp r e v i o u sm e t a -
analyses assessing the quantitative contribution of HPV, foundhigh geographic heterogeneity in HPV-attributable fractions(AFs) of OPSCC, ranging from <20% in Southern Europe to
more than 60% in North America [ 5,6,10,11]. Most of these es-
timations were based on HPV-DNA detection. However, HPV-
DNA detection alone is not sufﬁcient to classify an OPSCC as
HPV-driven since the presence of HPV-DNA could merely re-ﬂect a transitory infection and not an HPV-driven oncogenicprocess [ 12–15].
A recent study developed by our group estimated HPV–AFs in
different sites of HNSCC by quantifying the expression of a selec-tion of biomarkers of HPV-induced carcinogenesis in 3680 pa-
tients from 29 countries [ 7]. The global range of HPV–AFs for
OPSCC when considering two additional markers of viral biolo-gical activity (HPV-DNA plus E6*I mRNA and/or p16
INK4a) was
between 18.5% and 22.4%, substantially lower than that of 67.2%reported in North America [ 8]. With our regional estimates [ 7]
and Jordan et al.’s study [ 8] in order to cover the US data, we
were able to estimate the annual number of new incident OPSCC
cases attributable to HPV worldwide, in 25 409 [ 16], near to the
number of new cases recently estimated by the IARC of 29 000[9]. OPSCC includes tonsil and base of the tongue subsites, but
also cancer of the walls of the oropharynx and soft palate; how-
ever, the presence of HPV is much higher in the tonsils and base
of the tongue.
HPV-AFs for HNSCC, outside the oropharynx, are substantially
lower. It is interesting to note that despite the HPV-AFs for oralcavity and larynx squamous cell carcinomas described in previousmeta-analysis [ 5,6] (23.5%–24.2% and 24.0%–22.1%, respect-
ively), the prevalence is lower when evaluating robust single stud-
ies, ﬁnding a 5.9%–4.4% HPV-AFs for oral cavity and 3.5%–1.7%for larynx [ 7,17]. These differences, may be due to misclassiﬁca-
tion of anatomic subsites, as HPV-AFs for subsites within the oralcavity or the larynx that were more proximal to the oropharynxwere higher than those distant or to positive reporting bias [ 7].
Risk factors for HPV-related OPSCC
Smoking and alcohol consumption are the classic and well-
established risk factors for HNS CC, including OPSCC. Trends in
smoking prevalence differ signiﬁc antly across geographic regions,
and a notable decrease from 1980 to 2012 has been observed in mena n dw o m e ni nN o r t hA m e r i c aa n dN o r t h e r nE u r o p e[ 18]. In add-
ition, sexual behaviour is now established as a risk factor for HPV-
related OPSCC, with lifetime number of oral sex partners as the fac-tor most strongly associated with OPSCC. Furthermore, as forHPV16

Volume 28 | Issue 10 | 2017 doi:10.1093/annonc/mdx304 | 2387 smoking, the prevalence of oral sex dramatically differs across popu-
lations [ 17]. Other risk factors include open mouth kissing, vaginal
and any sex partners, aged /C2018 years at the time of ﬁrst oral sex, ma-
rijuana use and history of cervical HPV infection [ 19]. Thus, differ-
ences in risk factor exposure and se xual behaviour could explain in
part differences in AFs observed across regions and across decades.
It is still unclear whether tobacco and/or alcohol use can act
as co-factors and/or effect modiﬁers in the risk of developingHPV-related OPSCC. Recently, Anantharaman et al. reportedafter pooling two HNSCC studies with HPV16 serology data thatsmoking was consistently associated with increased risk of
OPSCC regardless of HPV status [ 20]. This suggests that HPV16
and smoking are independent risk factors, as it has been reportedpreviously [ 21–23]. Interestingly, new data have been reported
concluding that the population-level burden of HPV-relatedOPSCC is signiﬁcantly higher among ever-smokers than never-smokers in the USA, despite HPV-related OPSCC is characterised
as a disease of never smokers due to high HPV prevalence in
OPSCC among never-smokers [ 24].
When compared with patients with non HPV-related
OPSCC, patients with HPV-related OPSCC tend to be younger(aged<60 years) and to smoke and drink less; also a higher per-
centage of them are men (in most regions), and report moreoral sex partners and a higher socioeconomic status [ 22,25–27].
Age differences may be explained by differences in sexual prac-
tices in younger versus older coh o r t s .R e g a r d i n gg e n d e r ,ar e c e n t
systematic review on differences in the proportion of HPV-AFin OPSCC between men and women revealed a geographicheterogeneous pattern, showing the highest men to women
ratio in the USA (1.5) and the lowest in Asia and someEuropean countries (0.7) [ 28].
From infection to cancer: the natural history
Our current knowledge of the carcinogenic process from infec-
tion to cancer in OPSCC is still limited and mostly extrapolated
from the cervical cancer model. The mucosal lining of the tonsiland tonsillar crypts allows direct passage of not only immune cellsbut also of pathogens such as HPV [ 29]. When HPV infection is
not cleared, its persistence can lead to a precancerous lesion thatif it does not regress will eventually progress to invasive OPSCC(Figure 2). However, until now no oropharyngeal premalignant
disorders have been well established. Persistent infections may
progress to invasive cancer within 10 years [ 30], nevertheless the
majority of these infections, are cleared within a year or two [ 31].
On the other hand, global prevalence of oral HPV infection in
asymptomatic subjects is not yet well established. A meta-analysisof 4441 subjects showed that 4.5% had an oral HPV infection,
and that the rates among men and women were similar [ 32],
whereas in a more recent original study carried out in the US re-gion, prevalence of oral HPV infection was 6.9%, with a higherprevalence among men (10.1% versus 3.6%, P¼0.001) [ 33].

E6 and E7 early proteins have a main role in HPV-related OPSCC
carcinogenesis (Figure 3)[34]. E6 inhibits p53, while E7 binds to
pRb, promotes its degradation and the release of the E2F tran-scription factor [ 3,35]. This results in the de-regulation of the
G1/S cell cycle check point and the activation of S-phase re-entry
and viral replication. As a consequence of the E7 activation,p16
INK4ais overexpressed and released from the inhibitory activ-
ity of the pRb/E2F complex, allowing epithelial cells to escapefrom oncogene-induce senescence and to activated survival sig-nalling pathways [ 36]. p16
INK4aoverexpression is critical for cell
survival in HPV-associated tumours, while it is frequently inacti-
vated in HPV non-related tumours. This makes the p16INK4a
overexpression an acceptable surrogate marker of transcription-
ally active HPV in oropharyngeal carcinogenesis [ 37]. However,
p16INK4aoverexpression should be complemented with HPV
DNA detection to reduce the risk of misclassiﬁcation of HPV-negative tumours, which can sometimes maintain the p16
INK4a
expression [ 38]. Chromosomal instability, which greatly in-
creases the risk of accumulation of genomic alterations, the in-hibition of the apoptotic signalling and an increase of thetelomerase activity are associated directly with the E6/E7 expres-sion or the inactivation of p53 and pRB tumour suppressor genes[34,39].
E5 is not necessarily expressed but when it is, it inﬂuences a
variety of signalling pathways including the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR), the immune recognition and the apop-tosis regulation [ 40]. Other early proteins (E1, E2 and E4) are es-
sential to complete the viral cycle, but their activity is not crucialto promote the oncogenic transformation. The accumulation ofadditional genetic or epigenetic alterations and HPV integration
are also important events for neoplastic transformation and
tumour progression.HPV integration
It is well recognized for cervical cancer that HPV integration intothe host DNA allows greater expression of oncogenes E6/E7 andfavours oncogenesis; but this process is not mandatory[ 41]. A
whole-genome sequence study in HNSCC tumours revealed that
HPV integration impacted on the host genome by ampliﬁcation
of oncogenes and disruption of tumour suppressor genes as wellas driving inter/intrachromosomal rearrangements; Akagi et al.mapped HPV integration and proposed a model of ‘looping’ toexplain this procedure [ 42]. Moreover, distinct gene expression
proﬁles and DNA methylation patterns have been described in
tumours that show or not show HPV integration into the cell
genome [ 43]. Thus, HPV integration may play a role in genomic
instability modifying the outcomes on HPV-related OPSCC.Nevertheless, two recent studies, reported that the majority ofHPV-related OPSCC have either integrated or both episomal andintegrated HPV with no signiﬁcant differences in survival amonggroups [ 44,45]; however, based on advances in integration
technological assessment, further studies must be carried out.
Landscape of somatic genomic alterations in HPV-
related OPSCC and potential therapeutic targets
The Cancer Genome Atlas reviewed 279 HNSCC samples: 36
(13%) were classiﬁed as HPV-related and 33 (12%) were from
the oropharynx [ 46]. Different alterations in HPV-related
OPSCC were described: loss of TNF receptor-associated factor 3(TRAF3) (a tumour suppressor gene implicated in innate andacquired anti-viral responses, already described in nasopharyn-geal carcinoma), ampliﬁcation of E2F1, and an aberrant activa-tion of NF-KB and cell cycle. Moreover, a 3q amplicon
expression was found and included transcription factors such as
TP63, SOX2 and the oncogene PIK3CA, which are alsoG1

entiation and frequent deletions of 11q are shown containing the
ATM gene [ 46].
Signiﬁcant activating mutations of PIK3CA such as C >Tm u t a -
tions (E542K and E545K amino acid substitutions), have beendescribed in HPV-related tumours [ 46]. These mutations are
described to be related to a high activity of the apoliprotein BmRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) that
generates a mutation signature in virally transformed cancers [ 47].
Inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway may be thus an interest-ing target for these patients as it plays a key role in cellular metabol-ism, proliferation and survival. Multiple inhibitors targeting PI3K(BKM120, XL147) or PI3K-mTOR (BEZ235, XL765,GSK1059615) are currently under investigation [ 48]. Surprisingly,
results from the Beril-1, a phase II clinical trial with buparlisib
(BKM120: a pan-PI3K inhibitor) and paclitaxel had shown worse
PFS in HPV-related HNSCC patients than non HPV-related ones[49]. On the other hand, the PI3K pathway activation has been
proposed as one of the resistance mechanisms of EGFR inhibitorsin preclinical studies, suggesting that PI3K/mTOR inhibitors maybe developed in patients who are EGFR inhibitor-resistant in add-
ition to patients with the PIK3CA mutations [ 50]. However, in a
recent article studying cetuximab (anti-EGFR antibody) with orwithout PX-866 (PI3K inhibitor), no association between HPVstatus and response to treatment was found [ 51].
Targeting tyrosine kinase receptors may also be a potential
therapeutic tool against HPV-related OPSCC. Fibroblast growth
factor (FGF) pathway has been described as new likely thera-
peutic target in HPV-related OPSCC, with novel agents in activedevelopment [ 52]. Seiwert et al. demonstrated a prevalence of
17.6% of FGFR2 and FGFR3 somatic mutations among HPV-related tumours, importantly the FGFR3 S249C was recurrentlyidentiﬁed (previously reported in the TGCA study) [ 53].
Generally, the lack of EGFR aberrations in HPV-related
OPSCC is consistent in previous literature. EGFR alterations are
inversely correlated with HPV status with absent levels of EGFRprotein expression or gen ampliﬁcation among HPV-relatedHNSCC [ 46,54]. However, a subset of HPV-related OPSCC
expresses high EGFR levels and is associated with worse outcomes[55]. Anti-EGFR therapy is widely being used in de-escalation
clinical trials, relevant data about EGFR inhibition will be re-
ported in the following years.
Immune system in HPV-related OPSCC and poten-
tial therapeutic targets
A potential explanation for the survival beneﬁt of HPV-related
OPSCC patients may be due to tumour-inﬁltrating lymphocytes(TILs) conferring a protective effect through an adaptive host im-
mune response directed against viral antigens [ 56]. HPV16 E7-
speciﬁc T cells have been reported in OPSCC [ 57,58]. In a study
including 270 OPSCC patients, those expressing high versus lowlevels of TILs classiﬁed HPV-related patients into HR and low-risk groups: 96% 3-year-survival in HPV-related-high-TILs; and59% in HPV-related-low-TILs [ 59]. These data have been also
conﬁrmed in two further studies [ 60,61].
High expression of immune checkpoint receptors as pro-
grammed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1), in intra-tumoural regulatory T cells have been described in HNSCCpatients [ 62]. These ﬁndings support the role of PD-1 : PD-L1
interaction creating an ‘immune-privileged site’, ﬁnding around
70% of PD-L1 expression among HPV-related OPSCC examined
[63–65]. Furthermore, recent results have suggested a model, in
which TILs present in HPV-positive OPSCC, secrete INF-gammaand promote PD-L1 expression [ 66].
Clinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents in HNSCC are
currently being conducted studying HPV-related OPSCC as a
sub-group. Pembrolizumab (anti-PD1) has shown a response
rate of 20% in relapsed/refractory HNSCC [ 67], and a recently
new phase III clinical trial with nivolumab (anti-PD1) has dem-onstrated a signiﬁcant improvement in survival in patients withHNSCC progressing after cisplatin (1-year survival rate 36% ver-sus 16.6%), observing preliminary evidence that patients withp16
INK4apositive tumours may have a greater magnitude of nivo-
lumab effect, independent of level of PD1 expression [ 68].
Furthermore, bacterial/virus vaccines can deliver tumour anti-
gens acting as an immune adjuvant due to immune system re-sponses to a perceived infection [ 69]. Several such vaccines
against E7, E6/E7 or even E2-expressing are now under investiga-tion [ 70–72]. Adoptive T-cell transfer: T cells removed from a
patient, genetically modiﬁed or treated to enhance their activity
and reintroduced into the patient again, are also ongoing in aphase II trial on TILs for HPV-related cancers including HNSCC(NCT01585428) [ 69].
Clinical and histopathological differences
between HPV-related and non-HPV-related
OPSCC
HPV status has widely been described as an independent pre-
dictor of improved overall and disease-free survival (OS andDFS) in OPSCC patients [ 73]. One of the ﬁrst studies to demon-
strate these improved outcomes was conducted by Gillison et al.
A 74% reduction in risk of death from cancer among patients
with HPV-related OPSCC was found compared with those withnon HPV-related OPSCC (HR: 0.26; 95% CI 0.07–0.98) [ 74]. A
meta-analysis conﬁrmed the data showing that patients withHPV-related OPSCC have a 28% reduce risk of death (meta HR:0.72, 95% CI: 0.5–1) compared with non HPV-related OPSCC
[75].
Several phase II and III clinical trials in locally advanced
HNSCC have also shown a survival beneﬁt for patients withHPV-related cancers. Results from phase III clinical trials aresummarised in Table 1. In addition, the RTOG 0129 study indi-
cates that clinical factors, such as smoking history and stage,could also inﬂuence the prognosis of patients with HPV-related
HNSCC [ 76]. The combination of HPV status, tobacco smoking
(pack-year) and tumour stage has shown to classify patients ashaving a low, intermediate, or high risk of death: 3-year rates ofOS were 93% (95% CI 88.3–97.7), 70.8% (95% CI 60.7–80.8) and46.2% (95% CI 34.7–57.5), respectively [ 73]. Additional analyses
have indicated that patients with p16
INK4a-positive OPSCC with
T4 or N2c-N3 disease have a high risk of disease progression,
even if tobacco exposure is <10 pack-years [ 77]. It is estimated
that around 20% of HPV-related OPSCC patients have bad prog-nosis and this population needs to be clearly identify.ReviewAnnals of Oncology
2390 | Taberna et al. Volume 28 | Issue 10 | 2017 New classiﬁcations were proposed for the 8th edition AJCC-
TNM for HPV-related OPSCC, some of them including non-anatomic factor such as tobacco use [ 78–80]. Finally, a new TNM
staging system developed by O’Sullivan et al., with The
International Collaboration on Oropharyngeal cancer Networkfor Staging (ICON-S) and based on adjusted hazard ratios for theassessment of 1907 patients death risk, has been accepted for the8th edition TNM for HPV-related OPSCC, resembling the Nclassiﬁcation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma [ 81] (data are sum-
marized in Table 2). It is interesting to note that HPV-related
OPSCC patients were described as p16
INK4a-positive patients,
and no other biomarkers were used for its classiﬁcation.
HPV-related OPSCC are usually diagnosed in advanced stages,
with low tumour size (T) and high nodal dissemination [ 82,83].
From a histopathological perspective, HPV-related OPSCC areusually non-keratinizing, undifferentiated or basaloid squamous
cell carcinomas [ 74,82,84]. These cancers also show less second
primary neoplasms (SPN), probably due to less exposure to otherrisk factors such as tobacco use or alcohol consumption [ 85,86].
Moreover, transcriptionally active HPV is absent in the mucosa sur-rounding HPV-related OPSCC; therefore, the absence of a cancer-isation ﬁeld effect is another explanation for the fact that these
tumours develops less SPN and locoregional recurrences [ 87].
From a radiological point of view, they have well-deﬁned borders,very frequently cystic nodal involvement and could have small oreven occult primary tumours [ 88]. Main differences among HPV-
related and non-HPV OPSCC patients are summarised in Table 3.
As described before, only a small proportion of OPSCC is attrib-
uted to other HR HPV types rather than 16. A small retrospectivestudy demonstrated that no signiﬁcant survival differences were
found among HPV16 and non-HPV16 OPSCC patients [ 89].
Nevertheless, few data are available about the outcomes of non-
HPV16 related OPSCC and further studies are warranted.
Although the multimodal treatment of OPSCC makes it difﬁ-
cult to distinguish the effect of radiotherapy treatment from sur-gery or chemotherapy, clinical and pre-clinical studies supportthe evidence that HPV-related OPSCC are more radiosensitivethan non-related ones [ 90,91]. Radiosensitivity could be inﬂu-
enced by several factors associated with the molecular features of
HPV-related tumours. Apoptosis signalling after radiation ishigher in HPV-related OPSCC, probably due to the activation ofa basal fraction of wild-type p53, which is not present in HPV-negative tumours showing p53 somatic mutations [ 91]. The
inhibition of p53 and pRb due to the activity of E6 and E7 onco-proteins abrogates cell cycle check points, promotes fast progres-
sion through the S-phase and compromises the DNA repair
ability in epithelial cells. As a result of the impaired activation ofnon-homologous end joining and homologous recombinationDNA repair mechanisms, HPV-positive cells fail to resolveradiation-induced double strand breaks, increasing their intrinsicradiosensitivity [ 92,93]. p16
INK4aimpairs homologous recom-
bination DNA repair through the downregulation of cyclin D1,
and this could explain, at least in part, the prognostic and predict-ive value of p16
INK4aoverexpression in OPSCC [ 94,95]. Pre-
clinical studies show that the use of PARP inhibitors could be agood strategy to increase the radiosensitivity in HPV-positivecells showing defective homologous recombination repair path-ways [ 96]. HPV-related OPSCC radiosensitivity can beTable 1. Tumour HPV status and survival outcomes in phase III clinical trials in locally advanced HNSCC

tion of base-excision or single-strand break DNA repair mechan-isms or the lack of EGFR ampliﬁcation [ 96,97].
Differences in tumour microenvironment can also have an
important impact on radiation response. In this sense, hypoxia
signalling, which confer radioresistance in HPV non-related
OPSCC, is lower in HPV-related ones [ 98]. Although the E6 and
E7 activations are associated with the activation of mechanismsto evade the immune system response, immune inﬁltration ishigher in HPV-positive than in HPV negative tumours and thiscould be associated with an increased radiotherapy response [ 99].
HPV detection techniques
HPV testing is now mandatory for an accurate diagnosis and
prognosis of patients with OPSCC [ 100]. There are several avail-
able techniques such as p16INK4aIHC, detection of HPV-DNA by
in situ hybridisation (ISH) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
E6/E7 HPV-mRNA evaluation by ISH and reverse transcriptase–PCR (RT–PCR). Each technique yields different sensitivity andspeciﬁcity proﬁles, but E6/E7 HPV-mRNA evaluation is con-sidered the gold standard to conﬁrm HPV causality since it de-tects oncogene transcriptional active HPVs. Comparison of main
HPV detection techniques are summarised in Table 4.
The p16
INK4aexpression is a surrogate marker of HPV involve-
ment and it is the most widely implemented technique in the clin-ical setting. In OPSCC, p16
INK4ashows a high sensitivity ( /C2190%)and moderate ( >80%) speciﬁcity compared with HPV16 E6-
mRNA expression [ 101]. However, using p16INK4aIHC alone is
questionable, because a subset of HPV-DNA and mRNA-negative HNSCCs show diffuse p16
INK4astaining, indicating ex-
pression is not speciﬁc for HPV activity [ 102,103] (e.g. a muta-
tion on Rb can also overexpress p16INK4a)[46]. The discordant
rates are around 25% of the cases [ 104], being mostly p16INK4a-
positive and E6/E7 HPV mRNA-negative. In addition, there aresubstantial differences in how studies deﬁne p16
INK4aoverexpres-
sion. In general, p16INK4astaining has a high predictive value to
identify HPV-related cancers when the pattern shows a strong
and diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic staining in at least 70% or
more of the tumour [ 105]. It is important to remark that
p16INK4adetection outside of the oropharynx is an ineffective
diagnostic tool, the assay has very poor positive predictive valuein larynx and oral cavity carcinomas, indicating that p16
INK4a
IHC should not be used as a surrogate biomarker of HPV outsidethe oropharynx [ 106,107].
In the previously mentioned study from our group, we esti-
mated the odds ratios, sensitivity, speciﬁcity and area under theROC curve for a battery of biomarkers related to HPV (p16
INK4a,
pRb, CyD1 and p53), taking as gold standard HPV-DNA andE6*I mRNA positivity in OPSCC [ 7]. p16
INK4awas the marker
that showed the most consistent association with the gold stand-
ard with a statistically signiﬁcant higher area under the ROC
curve; thus we concluded that using p16INK4aand/or HPV-
mRNA in addition to HPV-DNA yielded the most accurate ap-proximation to judge HPV carcinogenicity. A recently publishedTable 4. Main human papilloma virus detection techniques

Volume 28 | Issue 10 | 2017 doi:10.1093/annonc/mdx304 | 2393 meta-analysis shows that the combination of p16INK4aIHC and
HPV DNA detection is the method with the highest speciﬁcity to
diagnose HPV-transformed OPSCC [ 108]. Interestingly,
Rietbergen et al. [ 109] demonstrated that patients with p16INK4a-
positive but HPV-DNA-negative OPSCC showed a signiﬁcantlyless favourable survival than patients with p16
INK4a-positive and
HPV-DNA-positive tumours ( P<0.001). This consideration
should be taken into account for describing HPV-related OPSCC
patients candidates for de-escalation treatment clinical trials, and
be aware that p16INK4aalone may not be the best biomarker to
use.
Treatment implications: de-escalation strat-
egies for locally advanced HPV-related
OPSCC
As described above, the proportion of HPV-related OPSCC has
increased drastically in the last decade in some developed coun-tries. Given that patients with HPV-related OPSCC have ayounger median age, the morbidity associated with current treat-
ments (xerostomia, necrosis, dysphagia, hypothyroidism, trache-
otomies, dental and hearing problems) may have a large impactfrom the clinical, social and economic point of view [ 73,110].
This, along with the fact that those patients show better progno-sis, has resulted in the interest in establishing de-escalation trialsseeking to maintain the OS while reducing acute and late toxicityderived from treatments.
Masterson et colleagues described four main de-escalation strat-
egies carried out for patients with HPV-related OPSCC [ 111].
1. Exploring cetuximab as an alternative to cisplatin when given
concurrently with intensity-modulated radiation therapy
(IMRT), attempting to reduce cisplatin late effects such asneuropathy, nephropathy and ototoxicity.
2. Reduction of radiation dose given in combination with
chemotherapy as primary treatment (guided by inductionchemotherapy response). Recently, results from the ECOG
1308 study have been published; induction chemotherapy
was utilised for local-regionally advanced HPV-positiveOPSCC to select responders for reduced dose radiotherapy to54 Gy. Two-years PFS and OS of 80% and 94% were reportedfor patients with primary site complete response.Importantly, 2-years PFS was signiﬁcantly higher among pa-tients with /C2010 pack-years compared with those with >10
pack-years of smoking (92% versus 57%; P¼0.014) [ 112].
3. Reduced dose of IMRT with or without cisplatin in low-risk
HPV-related OPSCC (Tobacco history <10 pack-year and
clinical stage T1–T2, N1–N2b or T3, N0–N2b.
4. Reduction of adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy dose
following primary treatment with surgery (stratiﬁed on the
basis of histopathology results).
Implementation of immunotherapy strategies in combination
with IMRT are the next de-escalation studies being developed.
Nevertheless, HPV-positivity st ill remains a prognostic fac-
tor and no change management decisions on HPV-relatedOPSCC patients should be carried out except in the context of aclinical trial.Preventative strategies
HPV immunisation targeting the L1 capsid proteins could be themost successful tool for primary prevention of HPV-relatedHNSCC. In controlled clinical trials, prophylactic HPV vaccines
show 90%–100% efﬁcacy in preventing vaccine-type HPV infec-
tions and associated anogenital precancerous lesions [ 113], and
have a great potential to reduce global anogenital cancer burden[114]. However, only one trial has shown reduction in prevalence
of oral HPV-infection 4 years after the HPV vaccine comparedwith placebo [ 115]. Recently; Pinto et al. demonstrated that vaccin-
ation of males induce HPV antibodies levels at the oral cavity that
correlate with circulating levels [ 116]. Moreover, HPV vaccination
appears to provide protection against vaccine-type oral HPV infec-tion among males and females in the general population [ 117].
Regarding secondary prevention, some proposals have been
described for a screening test. Transcervical ultrasonography isfeasible to evaluate and visualise base of the tongue cancers [ 118],
playing a role in high risk individuals if otherwise identiﬁed; and
HPV-DNA detection in oral rinses have the potential to deriveinto a screening tool, but very little data are available. Another po-tential tool for secondary prevention that has been postulated isHPV antibodies detection. HPV16 E6 seropositivity has been esti-mated to confer a 9–231 times increased risk for OPSCC [ 17,84].
HPV16 E6 serology has been identiﬁed in two large studies as a
promising predictive screening marker for OPSCC [ 119,120]. In
one of them, HPV16 E6 seropositivity was present in pre-diagnostic samples for 34.8% of patients with OPSCC and 0.6% ofcontrols, yielding an OR as high as 274 (95% CI 110–681) [ 119].
However, these strong associations may not necessary translate
into clinical utility, since the prevalence of OPSCC is still low and
thus, even a speciﬁcity of a test over 99% may have a very low posi-tive predictive value [ 121]. Moreover, there are not yet identiﬁable
precancerous lesions of the oropharynx at which to intervene andno proven interventions even if precancerous lesions were identi-ﬁed. Then, there is not yet a validated preventive screening tool forgeneral population and further investigation is warranted.
Regarding tertiary prevention, few data are available about
HPV persistent infection after completing deﬁnitive therapy. In apreliminary study, oral HPV-DNA detection by oral rinses after9, 12, 18 and 24 months post-treatment was evaluated [ 122].
Persistent HPV16 infection was associated with worse survival: 5of the 6 patients with persistent HPV-DNA detection progressed
in comparison to 9 of the 62 patients without persistent HPV-
DNA detection. Further investigation on the role of persistentHPV infection used as a potential tertiary prevention tool isneeded. However, one may take into account that operating char-acteristics, including low sensitivity (the prevalence of a positiveoral rinse at diagnosis was only 54%), low conﬁdence in the posi-tive predictive value, and high number needed to treat, preclude
immediate clinical adoption of the test [ 107].
Discussion
Conclusions
There has been a paradigmatic change in our understanding of
HNSCC, in particular for oropharyngeal cancer that is witnessingReviewAnnals of Oncology
2394 | Taberna et al. Volume 28 | Issue 10 | 2017 the effects of a new and emerging risk factor such as oral HPV in-
fection. The biology of HPV-related OPSCC is driven by E6 and
E7 oncogenes that degrade p53 and pRb, respectively.
Furthermore, recent activating mutations in PI3KCA and newimmunotherapy strategies have been described.
Since the incidence of HPV-related OPSCCs is rapidly increas-
ing, there is an urgent need to implement the most clinically validHPV diagnostic assays to correctly classify true HPV-driven
OPSCC and to rule out cancers with transient or oncogenic ir-
relevant HPV. This is important, in an era in which de-escalationtreatments are available and can avoid late toxicity in those youngpatients with potential better prognosis.
It is also necessary to emphasise that the best strategy to ﬁght
against cancer is prevention, especially when the pathogenicagent is known and identiﬁable and the primary prevention tool
such as HPV immunisation is available.
