Abstract
Objectives— Diagnosis with an HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer includes unique social issues. 
However, it is unknown how common these psychosocial issues are for patients and whether they 
continue after treatment.
Materials and Methods— Patients with pathologically confirmed HPV-positive oropharyngeal 
cancer (HPV-OPC, n=48) were recruited from two medical centers. Participants completed a 
computer assisted self interview that explored their psychosocial experiences during and after 
treatment. We examined responses overall and by age.
Results— The majority of participants with confirmed HPV-OPC, reported being told that HPV 
could have (90%) or did cause (77%) their malignancy, but only 52% believed that HPV was the 
main cause of their OPC. Participants over 65 years were less likely than younger participants to 
report that their doctors told them their tumor was HPV-positive (50% vs 84%, p=0.03).
Anxiety that their tumor was HPV-related was a major issue among participants when first 
diagnosed (93%). However, only 17% still reported anxiety after treatment was complete. While 
many patients reported that providers discussed the emotional effects of diagnosis and treatment 
adequately (58%), almost half reported discussing these emotional effects inadequately (24%), or 
not at all (18%). Further, 18% reported that their families still wondered about some questions that 
they had never asked.

Introduction
Recognition that human papillomavirus (HPV) causes a growing subset of oropharyngeal 
cancers is a relatively recent phenomenon. While the psychosocial implications of diagnosis 
with HPV have been extensively studied in people with HPV-related cervical pre-
malignancy and malignancy, analogous literature for head and neck cancer is lacking. A 
2005 report by the Institute of Medicine highlighted the importance of examining 
psychosocial issues in head and neck cancer patients.[ 1] Building upon this 
recommendation, the National Cancer Institute Steering Committee Clinical Trial Planning 
Meeting in 2011[ 2] recognized the unique and important social issues raised by HPV-related 
head and neck cancers, and called for studies to help establish standards of care for this 
unique patient population.
Despite these calls to study this patient population, data on psychosocial issues among HPV-
related head and neck cancer patients has been limited to descriptive qualitative studies with 
small sample sizes,[ 3,4] articles describing expert opinions,[ 1,5,6] or studies in head and 
neck cancer patients that do not consider HPV .[ 7,8] Nevertheless, the published studies to 
date suggest potential psychosocial issues at the time of diagnosis with HPV-OPC [ 4] that 
are specific to having a malignancy caused by a sexually transmitted infection. Whether 
psychosocial issues exist for many patients after treatment is unknown. With the growing 
prevalence of oropharynx cancer survivors[ 9,10], understanding their specific psychosocial 
needs emerges as an important consideration for both survivors and physicians.
Therefore, this study was designed to explore the psychosocial experiences of HPV-OPC 
survivors during and after treatment. Furthermore, we were interested in evaluating 
survivors’ understanding of HPV and OPC and their perceptions of provider communication 
regarding diagnosis of HPV-OPC.
Materials and methods
Study Design
This study included a one time survey assessment between September 2014 and February 
2015 of 48 patients with HPV-related oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (HPV-OPC) at 
either Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) or Johns Hopkins Head and Neck Surgery at Greater 
Baltimore Medical Center (GBMC), in Baltimore, Maryland. Patients with a prevalent 
diagnosis of oropharyngeal cancer were eligible. Participants at JHH included people 
diagnosed with HPV-OPC from 2009 to 2013 who were in follow-up as part of a different 
study[ 11] and were recruited to participate in this study (80% of those asked agreed). D’Souza et al. Page 2

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Participants approached for enrollment at GBMC were patients undergoing routine clinical 
surveillance (70% of patients approached agreed to participate).
Data Collection
Study participants completed a computer assisted self-interview (CASI). The survey 
included questions related to general knowledge of HPV-related OPC (e.g. “do you think 
HPV was the main cause of your cancer?”), and questions about their level of worry or 
anxiety. For example, patients were asked to rate their agreement with certain statements 
such as “when I was first diagnosed, I was anxious about the diagnosis of cancer” on a 5-
point Likert scale (strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree and strongly disagree). Using the 
same scale, they were also asked to rate their agreement with statements related to their 
relationships and sexual activity such as “since my doctor and I discussed the HPV status of 
my tumor, there has been significant tension between me and my partner or family 
members.”
Patients were also asked to describe the resources that were most helpful to them during and 
after treatment and about their experiences with their doctors after treatment (e.g. “now that 
you have completed therapy, do you feel that the long-term effects of cancer and treatment 
were explained to you?”). See Supplemental Table 1 for a copy of the survey instrument.
Data analysis
Medical record abstraction was performed to determine clinical characteristics and HPV 
tumor status, as available. Study population characteristics were described. Responses to the 
survey questions were compared by participants’ ages (≤55, 56–65, >65 years) and by years 
from cancer diagnosis (<2 years, 2–3 years, >3 years), using Fisher’s exact test. Level of 
agreement with survey questions was reported according to the scales used in those 
questions, including: 1) yes, no, don’t know; 2) strongly disagree/disagree, neutral, strongly 
agree/agree; 3) not at all, a little/somewhat, and very much.
All analysis used STATA version 14 (College Station, TX). While some analyses included 
all confirmed HPV- OPC cases, some questions were only asked to patients who 
remembered being told that their tumor was HPV-positive or those who finished cancer 
treatment, so analyses of these variables were restricted to these patient subsets.
Results
The study population comprised 48 participants diagnosed with HPV-OPC between 2009 
and 2014 (Table 1). All participants were confirmed to have HPV-positive tumor testing in 
their medical records. The majority of participants were male (n=45, 94%), white (n=43, 
90%), had never smoked tobacco (60%), and T3–T4 stage (56%). The median age at 
diagnosis was 60 years. Participants completed this survey a median of 3.0 years after 
diagnosis (range 0.1–5.6 years, interquartile range [IQR] =1.8, 3.9). At the time of the 
survey, 19% were currently undergoing treatment (n=9), and 81% had completed treatment 
(n=39).D’Souza et al. Page 3

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript The majority (n=43, 90%) of participants reported being told that HPV could  have caused 
their cancer, including 84% ever smokers and 93% of never smokers (Table 2). However, 
only 77% reported that their doctors actually told them that their tumor was HPV-positive, 
and only 52% thought that the main cause  of their cancer was HPV . This included 32% of 
ever smokers and 66% of never smokers who thought that HPV was the main cause  of their 
cancer. This proportion appeared to differ across age groups (Table 2), with older 
participants (>65 years) more likely than younger participants ( 65 years) to report not 
knowing whether HPV was the cause of their cancer (70% vs. 32%, p=0.07), and less likely 
to report that their doctors told them their tumor was HPV-positive (50% vs 84%, p=0.03).
Among those finished cancer treatment, approximately half (n=22, 58%) reported that their 
providers discussed the emotional effects of diagnosis and treatment. Another 24% (n=9) of 
patients said these emotional effects were briefly but not completely discussed, and 18% 
(n=7) reported that no one discussed the emotional effects of cancer with them (Figure 1). 
When asked if family members had remaining (unanswered) questions about cancer, 18% 
(n=7) reported that their families still wondered about some questions that they had never 
asked.
Experience, anxiety and beliefs of patients who recall being told their tumor was HPV-
positive
Additional questions regarding participants’ experience discussing their HPV tumor status 
were asked of the 37 patients (77%) who reported that their doctor told them that their tumor 
was HPV-positive. The majority of participants believed their providers adequately 
discussed their tumor status (n=34, 92%, Table 2). Over half of those surveyed reported the 
most useful HPV-related information at diagnosis was learning about rates of cure, survival, 
and treatment (n=18, 55%). Among all age groups, this was rated as the most helpful HPV-
related information providers discussed (Table 2). Other information learned at diagnosis 
that was reported to be helpful by more than 10% of patients included information on: 
acquisition and transmission of HPV (18%), how common HPV is (15%), and that HPV was 
the cause of their cancer (12%).
Next, the survey evaluated anxiety and beliefs related to the knowledge that HPV was 
responsible for the survivor’s cancer. Anxiety was a major issue among these participants. 
Nearly all participants reported that when first diagnosed they felt very anxious about the 
diagnosis of cancer (n=27, 93%, Table 3). Even after treatment was complete, 17% of cases 
reported strong feelings of anxiety that their tumor was HPV-positive. Several years after 
diagnosis some cases reported they continued to be very much  worried by how (16%) and 
why (14%) they became infected with HPV , and whether they were still infected with HPV 
(19%, Table 3). Nearly half of cases (49%) remained “a little or somewhat” worried after 
treatment about their HPV-positive tumor status (Table 3).
Most cases reported not worrying about transmission of HPV to their current partners (n=21, 
57%), family members (n=29, 83%), or future sexual partners (n=25, 89%). However, a 
small proportion of survivors reported continuing to strongly worry  about transmission of 
HPV to their current partner (n=3, 8%), family members (n=1, 3%), or future sexual partners 
(n=3, 11%), with many more survivors reporting intermediate levels of worry (Table 3).D’Souza et al. Page 4
Oral Oncol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 January 09.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Despite these worries, relationship dynamics seemed to remain largely intact, with only 2 
survivors (5%) reporting tension with their partner or family members following the 
discussion of their HPV-positive tumor status with providers (Table 3). Nearly all patients 
(34 of 37, 92%) remained married or in a committed relationship after diagnosis, and 72% 
reported that sexual intimacy was not affected by their diagnosis of HPV-OPC. However, 10 
cases (28%) did report decreased sexual activity after diagnosis. Patient experience, anxiety 
and beliefs did not vary by time since diagnosis (results not shown).
Perceived helpfulness of resources during and after therapy
We next explored which resources survivors viewed as helpful during diagnosis and 
treatment. The majority of respondents reported that conversations with medical oncologists 
(73%), radiation oncologists (87%), head and neck surgeons (86%), and nurses (65%) were 
very helpful during therapy (Figure 2). In contrast, after cancer treatment, survivors did not 
report that many resources aided with the emotional effects of their diagnosis. Among 39 
patients who completed cancer treatment, few patients reported that psychologists (n=2, 
5%), social support (n=8, 21%), church/prayer (n=12, 31%), or patient support groups/other 
(n=6, 15%) helped them with the emotional effects of cancer. In contrast, most patients did 
report that family members (n=30, 77%) helped with the emotional effects of treatment. 
Twenty-one percent of patients (n=8) reported that they did not talk to anyone (including 
family members) about the emotional effects of their cancer.
Of the challenges inquired about during treatment, most participants reported commonly 
anticipated side effects including swallowing difficulty (n=41, 85%), dry mouth (n=40, 
83%), and lack of taste (n=35, 74%). After completion of treatment, similar side effects 
persisted including common reports of dry mouth (n=30, 77%), lack of taste (n=26, 68%), 
and swallowing difficulty (n=27, 69%). Participants were also asked about post-treatment 
follow up care. Most patients reported they had received a treatment summary plan (n=26, 
67%), in-person reviews of follow-up care (n=32, 82%), and discussed the long-term effects 
of cancer treatment with their providers (n=31, 79%).
Discussion
This study provides one of the first descriptions of the knowledge gaps and psychosocial 
issues that arise after diagnosis and treatment with HPV-OPC. While most patients knew 
that HPV could have caused their cancer, almost half did not think HPV was the main cause 
of their cancer. This was especially pronounced among ever smokers. While most never 
smokers (66%) were told that HPV was the cause, only 32% of ever smokers were told that 
HPV was the main cause of their tumor. Among older patients, these knowledge gaps were 
more pronounced, with many older patients being unsure of the role HPV had in their 
cancer.
The finding that only half of providers discussed the emotional aspects of HPV-OPC 
diagnosis with patients highlights an opportunity to improve patient-provider 
communication and provider education. Despite not all patients having (or remembering) 
such a discussion of the emotional effects of their diagnosis with their provider, survivors 
generally reported low or no anxiety after completing treatment. However, some patients D’Souza et al. Page 5
Oral Oncol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 January 09.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript continued to have high levels of anxiety about their diagnosis, concern about transmitting 
HPV , and unanswered questions about HPV . Improving providers’ awareness regarding 
patient anxiety, both at the time of diagnosis and years after treatment, may help them to 
address the emotional effects of diagnosis with malignancy, that are compounded with the 
added complication of the causal relationship with sexually transmitted infection.
Other opportunities for providers to improve patient experience may include treatment 
summary plans and discussion of long-term side effects. Treatment summaries are 
recommended by the IOM to improve survivor quality of care.[ 12] These summaries include 
characteristics of patients’ diagnoses and therapy, which is supported by research indicating 
that written as well as verbal summaries improve patient understanding.[ 13] However, even 
with treatment summaries, there is still the possibility that patients will forget they had been 
given this information (recall bias).
Our finding that some patients were unaware that their tumors were HPV-positive is 
consistent with a previous study which found only 25% of diagnosed HPV-OPC patients 
recognized HPV as the primary cause of their cancer.[ 3] There are several possible reasons 
why older patients may have been less likely to know that their tumor was HPV-positive. 
First, older patients are often more likely to bring a companion or child to medical 
appointments,[ 14] which might make providers less comfortable explaining the role of an 
sexually transmitted infection. Second, older patients have lower health literacy and may be 
less able understand and/or to recall information concerning their disease even if their 
providers do discuss it [ 13,15]. It is also possible that older patients were less likely to ask 
about the cause of their cancer, and some physicians may not feel that a discussion of HPV 
is as relevant to an older individual since HPV-OPC is more common in younger age-
cohorts. However, approximately one-fourth of all HPV-OPC patients in the U.S. are 65 
years or older when diagnosed.[ 16] We note that recall bias is possible; i.e., providers may 
have reported to patients that their tumor was HPV-related, but the patients did not recall this 
when they completed the survey. To better identify the source of this knowledge gap, future 
studies might consider collecting parallel data from patients and their providers.
We also found that anxiety and worry are major issues among HPV-OPC patients. Although 
survival is increased for patients with HPV-OPC compared to HPV-negative OPC, 17% of 
patients in our study reported feeling anxious that their tumor was HPV-positive after 
treatment was complete. The HPV-related issues patients reported to be of most concern 
were how they became infected with HPV , why they became infected with HPV , and 
whether they are still infected  with HPV . These are domains of knowledge that can be 
addressed by multidisciplinary provider teams, and therefore represent additional 
opportunities for education.
This study had several strengths and limitations. Participants included a diverse sample of 
patients in terms of age and cancer stage. However, the sample size of the study was limited, 
and some participants did not remember being told their tumors were HPV-related so could 
not answer questions about their anxiety in having HPV-related cancer. The study population 
was primarily male and white, and results may not reflect the experience of female and 
minority patients.D’Souza et al. Page 6

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Conclusions
This is the one of the first studies to explore the psychosocial experience of patients during 
and after diagnosis with HPV-OPC. Patients’ understanding of and anxiety about the role of 
HPV in their cancer was variable, with lower awareness among older patients. The fact that 
most patients reported their providers discussed the emotional aspects of their diagnosis with 
them highlights how provider care and communication around this infection-related head 
and neck cancer has improved over the past 15 years. However, other patients reported no or 
inadequate discussion, unanswered questions, and continuing anxiety, representing potential 
opportunities to improve survivor quality of life.
