The 2010 NEJM paper by Ang et al. represents a secondary analysis of patients included in RTOG 0129 which showed a 25% difference in overall survival for patients with p16+ squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx. At three-years, for patients with T2-T4, N1-3 tumors, overall survival was 83%. Since his tumor is an even earlier stage, I believe that, with meticulous care, treatment is likely to be successful.
 
In fact, the multidisciplinary head and neck community has acknowledged the more favorable outcomes for this disease and has launched several efforts to tailor treatments and redesign our care for these patients – by de-escalating the intensity of treatment compared to patients with HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers – those typically associated with smoking and heavy alcohol use. HN002 has studied de-escalating the radiation dose from 68-70 Gy to 60 Gy. This trial is closed. 
 
An alternative to radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy (chemoRT) would be transoral endoscopic head and neck surgery using robotics. @HE@ could have a transoral resection and standard {left/right:29058} selective neck dissection (levels II-IV). For patients with N0-1 disease in the neck, a wide resection with good margins and no adverse features might permit @HIM@ to have frontline surgery without needing adjuvant radiation therapy. Even if additional nodes are seen, post-operative radiation doses could be de-escalated by 10-12% (from 66-68Gy to 60Gy). While this is a small reduction of dose, the toxicity curves for radiation therapy are quite incremental from 50 to 70Gy – thus, such a reduction would offer him a significant clinical benefit. 
 
A new study designed to test the efficacy of a next-generation flexible robotic surgical system (transoral robotic surgery or TORS) has also launched. Considering the risks and benefits of the possible treatments, I offered him TORS resection of the tumor -- this surgery was FDA approved in 2009
