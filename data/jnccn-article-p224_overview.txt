ABSTRACT
The NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers address tumors
arising in the oral cavity (including mucosal lip), pharynx, larynx, andparanasal sinuses. Occult primary cancer, salivary gland cancer, andmucosal melanoma (MM) are also addressed. The speci ﬁcs i t eo fd i s -
ease, stage, and pathologic ﬁndings guide treatment (eg, the appro-
priate surgical procedure, radiation targets, dose and fractionation ofradiation, indications for systemic therapy). The NCCN Head andNeck Cancers Panel meets at least annually to review comments
from reviewers within their institutions, examine relevant new data
from publications and abstracts, and reevaluate and update their rec-ommendations. These NCCN Guidelines Insights summarize the pan-
el’s most recent recommendations regarding management of HPV-
positive oropharynx cancer and ongoing research in this area.

JNCCN.org |Volume 20 Issue 3 |March 2022 225CE NCCN GUIDELINES®INSIGHTS Overview
The overall incidence of HPV-positive oropharynx can-
cers is increasing in the United States, whereas the inci-dence of HPV-negative (primarily tobacco- and alcohol-related) cancer is decreasing.
1The attributable fraction
for HPV in newly diagnosed oropharyngeal cancer is esti-mated to be 60% to 70% in the United States and parts ofthe European Union.
1–5Patients with HPV-positive can-
cer have tended to be younger6,7;h o w e v e r ,H P V - p o s i t i v e
oropharynx cancer rates are increasing among olderadults as the exposed cohorts age.
8,9Oral HPV16 infec-
tion increases the risk of oropharynx cancer,10–13and a
strong causal relationship has been established.10,11
HPV16 accounts for approximately 90% of cases, and
HPV18, 33, and 35 are responsible for the vast majority of
the small remaining fraction.6The prevalence of HPV16
is higher in oropharyngeal cancer than in cervical cancer(/C2450%), in which HPV18 is also highly prevalent.
2,14–16
Expression of the HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes inactivates
the tumor suppressor proteins p53 and pRb, respectively,which are frequently mutated in tobacco-related mucosalsquamous cell carcinomas. Inactivation of p53 and pRbpromotes genomic instability and the development ofcancer, and is responsible for the upregulation of p16protein expression, a reliable surrogate marker of the
presence of HPV DNA in these tumors. Genetic pro ﬁling
of HPV-positive cancer has demonstrated it to be geneti-cally distinct from HPV-negative squamous cell carci-
noma of the head and neck (SCCHN).
17
Analyses from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (2011 –2014), including 2,627 adults
aged 18 to 33 years, showed that HPV vaccination wasassociated with reduced vaccine-type oral HPV infection
(0.1% in vaccinated individuals vs 1.6% in unvaccinated
individuals; P5.008).
18Moreover, HPV vaccination in the
United States has led to herd protection against oral
HPV16, 18, 6, and 11 infections in unvaccinated men.19
Results of an ongoing randomized clinical trial to investi-
gate the ef ﬁcacy of HPV vaccines for the prevention of
oral HPV infections have not yet been reported. Although
data are not yet available, the HPV types that cause theoverwhelming majority of SCCHN are included in theHPV nonavalent vaccine (provides protection against 9
high-risk HPV types). Since there is evidence that vacci-
nation prevents HPV-related cervical and anal can-cers,
20–22the FDA expanded the indication for HPV
vaccination to include prevention of oral HPV infections
and related oropharyngeal cancers in 2020.Version 1.2022 © National Comprehensive Cancer Net work, Inc. 2022. All rights reserved.

226 © JNCCN —Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network |Volume 20 Issue 3 |March 2022 Patients with locally advanced HPV-positive SCCHN
have improved response to treatment and survival (over-all survival [OS] and progression-free survival [PFS]) whencompared with HPV-negative tumors.
23–29Treatment
response is improved in patients receiving radiation ther-apy (RT) or chemoradiation.
23,30,31A meta-analysis includ-
ing 18 studies with 4,424 patients with SCCHN showedthat patients with tumors that were both HPV-positiveand p16-positive had better 5-year OS and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) than patients with tumors that wereHPV-negative/p16-negative, HPV-positive/p16-negative,and HPV-negative/p16-positive.
32However, patients with
tumors that were HPV-negative/p16-positive had greater5-year OS than patients with tumors that were p16-nega-tive (regardless of HPV status). Discrepancies between
HPV status and p16 status are usually attributable to use
of assays for HPV detection that do not cover all high-riskHPV types.
33
The impact of smoking and cancer stage on survival
of patients with HPV-positive SCCHN has been investi-gated in numerous studies.
34–36For example, analyses of
patients with oropharyngeal cancer who were enrolled inRTOG 9003 or 0129 (n 5165) showed that smoking was
associated with decreased OS and PFS, regardless of p16status.
34An analysis of data compiled from 4 cooperative
group trials estimated that never smokers had a 51% (haz-ard ratio [HR], 0.40; 95% CI, 0.33 –0.75) reduction in risk of
cancer progression when compared with former and cur-rent smokers with HPV-positive SCCHN.
36A retrospective
analysis from a clinical trial (RTOG 0129) showed no dif-
ference in the rate of distant metastasis in patients with
p16-positive versus p16-negative disease.23Additional
analyses have suggested that individuals with T4 or N3disease or radiographically detectable matted lymph nodesmay have a worse prognosis, and therefore should be
excluded from deintensi ﬁcation trials.
37–40These studies
on prognostic and predictive factors in HPV-positive oro-pharyngeal cancers form the basis for RT deintensi ﬁcation
studies. Moreover, the striking difference in prognosis forHPV-positive versus HPV-negative SCCHN led to the crea-tion of new AJCC staging criteria in 2018 (see later section
on“Treatment, ”page 228).
HPV Testing
The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN
Guidelines) for Head and Neck Cancers recommend tumor
HPV testing by p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) in all
patients diagnosed with an oropharyngeal cancer. There areVersion 1.2022 © National Comprehensive Cancer Network, Inc. 2022. All rights reserved.

JNCCN.org |Volume 20 Issue 3 |March 2022 227 currently no diagnostic tests with regulatory approval. A few
HPV testing options are available for use in the clinical set-
ting. Expression of p16 as detected by IHC is a widely avail-able surrogate biomarker that has very good agreement withHPV status as determined by HPV E6/E7 mRNA expres-sion.
33,41–44Other tests include HPV detection by PCR and in
situ hybridization (ISH).33,42Sensitivity of IHC staining for
p16 and PCR-based assay is high, although speci ﬁcity is
highest for ISH.42Analyses of HPV testing methods have
shown that sensitivity and speci ﬁcity of p16 IHC range from
94% to 97% and 83% to 84%, respectively, with sensitivity
and speci ﬁcity of HPV16 ISH ranging from 85% to 88% and
88% to 95%.33,43The reduced speci ﬁcity for p16 IHC may be
due to the presence of p16-positive tumors that do not haveevidence of HPV DNA, whereas the reduced sensitivity forH P V 1 6I S Hm a yb ed u et ot h ep r e s e n c eo fo t h e rh i g h - r i s kHPV types in the tumor. Due to variations in sensitivity andspeciﬁcity values of testing options, multiple methods may
be used in combination for HPV detection.
6,42,43,45,46Sufﬁ-
cient pathologic material for HPV testing can be obtained byﬁne-needle aspiration.
6,47Guidelines for HPV testing have
been published by the College of American Pathologists.48
HPV testing may prompt questions about prognosis and sex-ual history that the clinician should be prepared to address.Treatment
Expert consensus is that HPV status should be used as astratiﬁcation factor in clinical trials, or clinical trial eligi-
bility should be restricted to one or the other patient
population.
49–51With some exceptions, the treatment
algorithms in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and NeckCancers for p16-negative and p16-positive oropharyngealcancer are identical. It is the stance of the panel that
there is currently no evidence that the staging criteria
published in the 8th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging
Manual
52should drive clinical decision-making, as it is
currently unknown how to therapeutically address the
vast biologic differences between the 2 distinct cancers.The panel urges that patients with HPV-positive cancers
be enrolled in clinical trials evaluating biologic and treat-
ment-related questions.
53–55
Some clinicians have suggested that less-intense treat-
ment may be adequate for HPV-positive oropharyngeal
cancers (ie deintensi ﬁcation).38Although not considered
deintensi ﬁcation, other RT-based strategies that may be
used to potentially minimize harm in patients with p16-
positive oropharyngeal cancer include use of image-guided
RT and consideration of unilateral neck irradiation in dis-ease that is well-lateralized.

tensiﬁcation treatment protocols for HPV-positive locally
advanced oropharyngeal cancer are being investigated inongoing clinical trials. Strategies under active investigationinclude reducing or using response-strati ﬁed RT dose,
using RT alone versus chemoradiation, using less invasivesurgical procedures such as transoral laser microsurgery ortransoral robotic surgery (TORS), using sequential systemictherapy/RT, and using immunotherapy.
54,56,59
Early-stage (ie, T1 –T2N0) p16-positive oropharyngeal
cancers may be treated with de ﬁnitive RT or resection of
the primary with neck dissection60–63(see ORPHPV-1, page
226). Tumors at or approaching the midline (ie, tumors inthe base of the tongue, posterior pharyngeal wall, soft pal-ate, and tonsil invading the tongue base) are at risk forcontralateral metastasis and warrant bilateral treatment.
The randomized phase II ORATOR trial aimed to compare
swallow-related QoL outcomes in patients with early-stageT1–T2,N0 –2 oropharyngeal cancer treated with primary RT
or systemic therapy/RT versus those treated with TORS withneck dissection with or without adjuvant RT or systemictherapy/RT.
64The study enrolled 68 patients from 6hospitals in Canada and Australia (88% were p16-positive),
and compared MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory(MDADI) scores between the 2 groups at 1 year. Swallow-related QoL outcomes reached statistical signi ﬁcance favor-
ing the primary RT cohort; however, this difference did notmeet criteria for a clinically meaningful change, and withlong-term follow-up the difference in scores became lesspronounced with the passage of time.

showed that there were excellent and similar PFS and OSrates in both arms. The authors concluded that “RT- and
TORS-based approaches were associated with clinically sim-ilar QoL outcomes, but differing spectra of toxicities, anddifferences in QoL between arms decreased over time. Clini-cians and patients should be involved in shared decision-making, in a multidisciplinary context, to individualize treat-
ment of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. ”

T3N0 –1) demonstrated that de-escalated RT to 60 Gy
with concurrent cisplatin was associated with a 2-yearPFS rate of 90.5%, and accelerated RT alone to 60 Gy was
associated with a 2-year PFS rate of 87.6%.
72The former,
but not the latter, regimen met criteria for further studyand is the subject of an ongoing cooperative group phase
II/III randomized trial on dose de-escalation. Similarly, a
nonrandomized phase II study of de ﬁnitive RT to 60 Gy 6
concurrent cisplatin in 114 patients with T0 –3N0–2M0
p16-positive oropharyngeal cancer demonstrated a 2-year
PFS of 86% and 2-year OS of 95%.
70Analyses of quality
of life (QoL) outcomes from one of these trials68showed
that RT deintensi ﬁcation was associated with a quicker
and more robust return to baseline-level functioning.73
A prospective phase II trial of initial TORS followed by
risk-adapted adjuvant treatment demonstrated a 2-year
PFS rate of 96.9% for low-risk disease with TORS alone,
94.9% for intermediate-risk disease with 50 Gy adjuvantRT, 96% for intermediate-risk disease with 60 Gy adju-vant RT, and 90.7% for high-risk disease with 66 Gy adju-
vant RT with concurrent weekly cisplatin.

Research on the impact of adverse features such as
extranodal extension and number of involved nodes onoutcomes in patients with p16-positive disease who have
undergone resection is rapidly evolving. Analyses fromthe RTOG 9501
75and EORTC 22931 trials,76prior to the
era of p16/HPV testing, showed that extranodal extensionis associated with poor prognosis and demonstrated ben-

77Data suggesting equivalent outcomes of
adjuvant RT and systemic therapy/RT for p16-positive
oropharyngeal cancer with extranodal extension are
restricted to retrospective trials,35,49,78–83although clinical
trials are being conducted to validate the revised AJCCstaging
52for clinical decision-making. Secondary to a lack
of high-quality, prospective clinical evidence in the mod-
ern era, systemic therapy/RT is a category 2A option forpatients with p16-positive disease and extranodal exten-sion. Adjuvant systemic therapy/RT remains a category 1recommendation for patients with nonoropharyngeal
SCCHN who have extranodal extension. Because patients
with p16-positive oropharyngeal cancer have a generallyfavorable prognosis and may live longer, toxicity and QoLare concerns for these patients.

they are also younger, with fewer comorbidities, so they
can probably tolerate combined adjuvant therapy better.Version 1.2022 © National Comprehensive Cancer  Network, Inc. 2022. All rights reserved.

7 Based on published data, concurrent systemic th erapy/RT most commonly uses conventional 
fractionation at 2.0 Gy per fraction to a typi cal dose of 70 Gy in  7 weeks with single-
agent cisplatin given every 3 weeks at 100 mg/m2; 2–3 cycles of chemotherapy are used 
depending on the radiation fractionation sche me (RTOG 0129) (Ang KK, et al. N Engl J 
Med 2010;363:24-35). When carboplatin and 5-FU are used, the recommended regimen 
is standard fractionation plus 3 cycles of ch emotherapy. [Bourhis J, et al. Lancet Oncol 
2012;13:145-153]. Other fraction sizes (eg, 1.8 Gy, conventional), multiagent chemotherapy, 
other dosing schedules of cisplatin, or altered fractionation with chemotherapy are efficacious, 
and there is no consensus on the optimal ap proach. In general, the use of concurrent 
systemic therapy/RT carries a high toxicity burd en; altered fractionation or multiagent 
chemotherapy will likely further increase the toxicity burden. For any systemic therapy/RT 
approach, close attention should be paid to published reports for the specific chemotherapy 
agent, dose, and schedule of ad ministration. Systemic therapy/ RT should be performed by an 
experienced team and should include substant ial supportive care. See Discussion.►►

should be strongly considered for bilateral treatment of
the neck. The panel asserts that concurrent systemictherapy/RT is preferred in patients with locoregionallyadvanced HPV-positive disease who have clinical evi-
dence of ﬁxed or matted nodes or obvious extranodal
extension, because surgery is not recommended for thesepatients. Induction chemotherapy (followed by RT or sys-temic therapy/RT) is listed as a treatment option forthese patients,
60,62,86but is a category 3 option due to lack
of consensus among NCCN Member Institutions. Panel
concerns are based on absence of consistent bene ﬁto f
induction chemotherapy in randomized clinical trialsand concerns that use of better-tolerated —but potentially
less effective —concurrent regimens or poorer patient com-
pliance with RT may compromise outcomes. For moredetail, see the Discussion section in the full version of theNCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers (available at
NCCN.org). Patients with cN2 –3 disease who are treated
with initial surgery have a high likelihood of extranodalextension, which warrants adjuvant systemic therapy/RTtreatment. Triple modality management is associated withincreased toxicity. Beginning treatment with concurrentsystemic therapy/RT may help decrease the need for triplemodality therapy and additional treatment-induced mor-
bidity. Therefore, de ﬁnitive concurrent systemic therapy/
RT is preferred over up-front surgery for p16-positive cT4or cN3 oropharyngeal cancer (see ORPHPV-4, page 229).Version 1.2022 © National Comprehensive Cancer Net work, Inc. 2022. All rights reserved.

JNCCN.org |Volume 20 Issue 3 |March 2022 231 In 3 randomized phase III trials, cetuximab 1RT
was compared with cisplatin 1RT as a deintensi ﬁcation
treatment strategy for HPV-positive locally advanced oro-pharyngeal cancer, but cetuximab 1RT proved to be
inferior to cisplatin (in terms of OS) and was not bettertolerated.
87,88In the RTOG 1016 noninferiority trial, 849
patients with locally advanced HPV-positive oropharyn-geal cancer were randomized to receive accelerated
intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) with either cetuximab or
cisplatin.
87After a median follow-up of 4.5 years, the
cetuximab arm did not meet the criterion for noninfer-iority (based on 5-year OS). Five-year OS was 77.9% forthe cetuximab arm and 84.6% for the cisplatin arm. PFSand risk of locoregional failure were signi ﬁcantly worse
in the cetuximab arm compared with the cisplatin arm(HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.29 –2.29; P,.001 for PFS; HR, 2.05;
95% CI, 1.35 –3.10; P,.001 for locoregional failure), with
5-year PFS and locoregional failure rates being 67.3% and17.3% for the cetuximab arm, and 78.4% and 9.9% for thecisplatin arm, respectively. In the randomized phase IIIDe-ESCALaTE HPV trial, cetuximab 1RT was compared
with cisplatin 1RT in 334 patients with locally advanced
p16-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
88
Patients treated with cisplatin 1RT had signi ﬁcantly bet-
ter 2-year OS (97.5% vs 89.4%, respectively; HR, 5.0; 95%
CI, 1.7 –14.7; P5.001) and a lower recurrence rate (6.0%
vs 16.1%, respectively; HR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.6 –7.2;P,.001)
than those treated with cetuximab 1RT. In the multicen-
ter TROG 12.01 trial, 189 patients with intermediate-riskHPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer were randomized toreceive 70 Gy RT with either weekly cisplatin or cetuxi-mab.
89The 3-year failure-free survival was 93% in the
RT/cisplatin arm and 80% in the RT/cetuximab arm
(P5.015). These 3 phase III trials demonstrated that
cetuximab and RT was inferior to cisplatin and RT inpatients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer.
87–89
When concurrent systemic therapy/RT is recommendedfor treatment of locoregionally advanced p16-positivecancer of the oropharynx, the panel asserts that high-dose cisplatin is the preferred systemic agent, although
weekly cisplatin is also an option. An NRG Oncology trial
is currently in progress for comparing high-dose cisplatinto weekly cisplatin in locally advanced SCCHN (Clinical-Trials.gov identi ﬁer: NCT05050162).
RT Fractionation
IMRT is preferred for radiation treatment of oropharynx
cancer, because it is associated with decreased toxicity.90,91There is an ongoing randomized trial comparing IMRTwith intensity-modulated proton therapy in oropharyngealcancer (ClinicalTrials.gov identi ﬁer: NCT01893307). A
fractionation schedule of 66 to 70 Gy at 2 Gy/fractiondaily (Monday –Friday) for 6 to 7 weeks is recommended
for patients with gross disease. Hypofractionation,hyperfractionation, or accelerated fractionation isacceptable in patients with early-stage oropharyngeal
cancer and may be associated with improved locore-
gional control.
84,92For elective nodal treatment, a biolog-
ically equivalent dose of approximately 40 to 50 Gy in 2Gy/fraction is recommended.
84,93The complete list of
recommended schedules for radiation treatment of p16-positive oropharynx cancer are shown in the algorithm(see“Principles of Radiation Therapy, ”ORPH-A 1 and 2,
pages 230 and 231). Despite the evidence that RT dose
deintensi ﬁcation may improve long-term function while
preserving PFS in patients with p16-positive disease,
67–69,73
more studies are needed in this area. The majority of clini-cal trials in this space have been single-arm phase II andneed to be compared with the standard of care in ran-domized trials. Currently, enrollment of patients withlow-risk HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer is in pro-gress for the randomized phase II/III NRG HN-005
trial, which will compare de-escalated 60 Gy with cis-
platin, 60 Gy with nivolumab, and 70 Gy with cisplatin(NCT03952585).
Summary
The incidence of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer isincreasing in the United States, and patients with locallyadvanced HPV-positive SCCHN have improved out-
comes relative to patients with HPV-negative tumors.
The NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers rec-ommend tumor HPV testing in all patients with oro-pharyngeal cancer. Treatment deintensi ﬁcation (eg,
dose-reduced RT) is an active area of research withpromising preliminary results. However, de ﬁnitive
data from randomized phase III trials must be avail-able before RT deintensi ﬁcation for HPV-positive can-
cers is considered a standard option. Ongoing clinical
trials speci ﬁct ot h i su n i q u es u b s e to fh e a da n dn e c k
cancers are anticipated to further inform these NCCNGuidelines.
