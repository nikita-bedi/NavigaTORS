 3 ABSTRACT 
 
Background:   
There has been increasing interest in primary surgi cal treatment of patients with early T 
classification (T1vT2) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), with the stated goal of 
devescalating or avoiding adjuvant treatment.   We sought to determine the degree to which this 
interest has translated into changes in practice pa tterns, and the rates of adverse postvoperative 
pathologic features. 
 
Methods:   
Patients with T1vT2 OPSCC in the National Cancer Da tabase (NCDB) treated from 2004v2013 
were categorized as receiving primary surgical or p rimary radiationvbased treatment.  Trends in 
treatment selection and factors related to selectio n of primary surgery were examined. The rates 
of adverse pathologic features including positive m argins, extracapsular spread (ECS), and 
advanced T and N stage following surgery were analy zed.  
 
Results:   
Of 8,768 patients with T1vT2 OPSCC, 68% received pr imary surgical treatment, increasing from 
56% in 2004 to 82% in 2013 (p<0.0001). The highest versus lowest volume hospitals treated 
78% versus 59% of patients with primary surgery (O. R. 2.23 C.I. 1.55v3.22, p<0.0001). Higher 
nodal stage predicted lower rates of primary surger y, but the majority of patients with clinical 
N2/N3 disease underwent primary surgery. Among surg ical patients, positive margins were 
present in 24% and ECS in 25%. Positive margins dec reased over time (p<0.0001) and were seen 
less often at high volume centers (p<0.0001). Among  candidates for single modality therapy 
(clinical T1vT2/N0vN1), 33% had positive margins an d/or ECS, and 47% had at least one 
adverse feature (T3vT4, N2vN3, positive margins, an d/or ECS). 
 
Conclusion: 
Primary surgical treatment for early Tvstage OPSCC has become more widespread.

 4 INTRODUCTION 
The incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcin oma (OPSCC) in the United States (US) is 
rising, and is projected to double by 2030, to more  than 15,000 diagnoses per year.1  In addition 
to the classic risk factors of chronic tobacco and alcohol exposure, the human papillomavirus 
(HPV) has emerged as the leading causative agent fo r OPSCC in the US and other countries.2, 3 
Compared to patients with tobaccovassociated OPSCC,  patients with HPVvassociated OPSCC 
are, on average, younger at diagnosis, have fewer c omorbid illnesses, and have a superior 
prognosis. 4v6   At presentation, HPVvassociated OPSCC tumors com monly present with low T 
classification (T1vT2), but advanced stage (Stage I IIvIV), owing to nodal metastases.7, 8  
 
Uncertainty persists about the most appropriate tre atment strategies for patients with OPSCC. 
Prior to the 1990s, primary surgery and primary rad iotherapy were the most commonly 
employed strategies. In the late 1990s, organ prese rvation trials demonstrated survival benefits of 
chemoradiotherapy (CRT) over radiotherapy (RT) alon e,9 leading to increased use of CRT in the 
early 2000s. 10, 11  However, there has recently been renewed enthusias m for primary surgical 
approaches for the treatment of OPSCC 12v14 . This has been driven by technologic advances such  
as transoral robotic surgery (TORS) that enhance th e feasibility of surgery for low T 
classification OPSCC and offer the potential of avo iding or devescalating adjuvant treatments. 
TORS was approved by the Food and Drug Administrati on (FDA) in 2009. 
 
In order to achieve the goal of minimizing the exte nt of postoperative therapy for patients with 
early Tvstage OPSCC, it is important to select pati ents appropriately for one of two current 
standard initial treatment strategies: primary surg ery or primary radiation with or without Page 4 of 26 Cancer

 5 chemotherapy. Specifically, surgical patients shoul d ideally be those in whom the likelihood of 
adverse pathologic risk factors is low. According t o National Comprehensive Cancer Center 
(NCCN) guidelines, the adverse risk factors that pr ompt escalation of adjuvant therapy include 
N2vN3 nodal status, advanced pathologic T classific ation, positive margins, the presence of 
lymph nodes with extracapular spread (ECS), and tum or perineural invasion or lymphovascular 
invasion.15  Conversely if patients have none of these adverse features they may be treated with 
surgery alone. 
 
While recent work has examined variables associated  with patients treated with TORS since 
FDA approval 16 , there is limited knowledge of national trends in the primary treatment strategy 
for patients with early Tvstage OPSCC before and du ring the TORS era, particularly the factors 
associated with a decision to triage patients to pr imary surgical therapy, and the success of 
physicians in selecting patients for surgery in who m adverse pathologic features are not present.  
The goal of this study was to use a large, high qua lity US cancer registry to examine these 
questions at a national level.  
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Data Source 
The data source for this study was the National Can cer Database (NCDB), a joint program of the 
Commission on Cancer (CoC) and the American College  of Surgeons (ACS) that collects

Study Cohort  
We identified all patients with clinically staged T 1 and T2 OPSCC diagnosed between 2004v
2013 who were ≥ 18 years old. We included ICDO code s for the “oropharynx” (ICDO C019, 
C090, C091, C098, C099, C100, C101, C102, C103, C10 4, C108, C109, C142). We included 
only patients with histologically proven squamous c ell carcinoma tissue examined by 
microscope rather than cytology alone; the tissue c ould be examined from biopsy or surgical 
pathology specimens. We excluded patients who had r eceived part or all of their treatment 
outside of the NCDB reporting facility in order to be certain whether or not the various possible 
primary treatments were in fact delivered, and in w hat order. Patients were also excluded if 
treatment information was missing or for whom the s equence of treatments was not clear, and 
whose staging information was inconsistent with tre atment information or could not be assessed 
(Figure 1). The total cohort with complete data was  8,768 patients. 
 
Outcomes 
The main outcome was the choice of primary treatmen t modality. Patients were categorized as 
receiving “primary radiation” or “primary surgical”  treatment.  The primary treatment modality 
was determined to be radiation if they did not rece ive primary surgery but had undergone 
radiation. The primary modality was surgery if they  received surgery before any radiation or 
chemotherapy.  A “local tumor excision” such as exc isional biopsy was not considered primary 
surgery. For tonsil and other oropharynx all catego ries of “pharyngectomy” were used; 91% 
were “Limited/partial pharyngectomy” which includes  tonsillectomy, 4% were “Pharyngectomy 
NOS,” 2% were “total pharyngectomy,” 1% were “radic al pharyngectomy,” and the rest were Page 6 of 26 Cancer

 7 other subclassifications of pharyngectomy. Base of tongue tumors (ICD C019) are listed with 
other tongue tumors; primary surgical patients were  those who underwent at least “glossectomy” 
and not “local tumor excision.” 
 
A secondary outcome was the presence of adverse pat hologic features among those who 
underwent primary surgical treatment.  For this ana lysis, we included only those patients 
undergoing primary surgery who had complete informa tion on margin status and ECS (Figure 1). 
 
Tumor characteristics 
Clinical T and N classification were used for the a nalysis of predictors of primary treatment 
modality since patients who did not have surgery di d not have pathologic information. For the 
secondary analysis of pathologic factors among thos e undergoing primary surgery, T and N 
classification were each described according to bot h clinical and pathologic staging. ECS is 
defined in the NCDB as either negative, microscopic , macroscopic, or unknown; for this analysis 
ECS was determined to be positive if micro or macro scopically positive. Margins were defined 
as positive if there was microscopic or macroscopic  “residual tumor.” Close margins are not 
recorded in the NCDB and would be considered negati ve by coding rules. 
 
Covariates 
Patient sociodemographic factors included age, sex,  race, insurance status (grouped as private, 
uninsured, or government insurance including Medica re and Medicaid), and comorbidities 
(CharlsonvDeyo Comorbidity index 18 ). Hospital volume was defined as the total new OPS CC 
cases seen over all years from 2004v2013, with hosp itals divided into quartiles by volume for Page 7 of 26 Cancer

 8 analysis. Hospital type was defined as either  “aca demic,” which included Academic/Research 
programs as well as National Cancer Institute (NCI) vdesignated Comprehensive Cancer Centers, 
or “community,” which included Community Cancer Pro grams, Comprehensive Community 
Cancer Programs, Integrated Network Cancer Programs , and other specified types of programs. 
 
Analysis 
We used descriptive and chivsquared statistics to c ompare tumor, patient sociodemographic, and 
hospital factors among patients who underwent prima ry surgery versus primary radiation 
treatment. The CochranvArmitage trend test was used  to determine whether the proportion of 
patients treated with a primary surgical approach ( versus primary radiation approach) changed 
over time. For multivariable analysis we used hiera rchical generalized linear models with a logit 
link to account for clustering of patients within h ospitals while evaluating the influence of tumor, 
patient sociodemographic, and hospital factors on t he binary choice of primary treatment 
modality. The large sample size allowed us to inclu de all variables of interest in the multivariable 
model and no model selection was necessary. For the  secondary analysis of pathologic factors 
among those undergoing primary surgery, we used des criptive statistics as well as the Cochranv
Armitage trend test to examine how these pathologic  features changed over time. As a sensitivity 
analysis for one of these pathologic features (marg in positivity), we also performed logistic 
regression of year on margin positivity to ensure t hat the trend over time was in a downward 
direction. Pvvalues <0.05 were considered significa nt. Analyses were conducted using Stata 
Statistical Software (Release 12.1; Stata Inc., Col lege Station, TX).

 9 Characteristics of the cohort 
We identified 8,768 patients who presented with T1 and T2 OPSCC between 2004v2013 (Table 
1).  The majority were male (79%), age 50v64 (55%),  and were white (92%).  The majority had 
private insurance (68%) and zero comorbidities (82% ). Slightly less than half (49%) were treated 
at community cancer programs. While 26% were treate d at higher volume hospitals that saw >50 
patients with OPSCC, another 34% were treated at lo w volume hospitals where only 10 or fewer 
patients with OPSCC were treated between 2004v2013.  Regarding tumor factors, 47% of patients 
presented with clinically classified T1 tumors, and  53% with T2 tumors, while 26% had 
clinically or radiographically classified N0 diseas e, 23% had N1 disease, 47% had N2 disease, 
and 3% had N3 disease at presentation. 
 
Primary treatment selection 
Overall 68% (5967) of patients underwent primary su rgical treatment. From 2004v2013 the use 
of the primary surgical approach increased over tim e from 56% of patients in 2004 to 82% in 
2013 (p< 0.0001; Figure 2). Patients selected for p rimary surgical treatment tended to have lower 
nodal disease status at presentation (81% of N0, 67 % of N1, 63% of N2, and 54% of N3 selected 
for surgery, p<0.0001, Table 1 Column 2).  Patients  undergoing primary surgery tended to have 
private insurance compared to no insurance or gover nment insurance (69% vs 62% and 67% 
respectively, p=0.007). Patients treated at academi c hospitals received a primary surgical 
approach more often than those treated at community  hospitals (74% vs. 62%, p<0.0001), and 
patients treated at the highest volume hospitals re ceived a primary surgical approach more often 
than those treated at the lowest (78% vs. 59%, p<0. 0001; Table 1 Column 2).

 10 Factors associated with primary surgery 
On multivariable analysis, in addition to the year of diagnosis, several tumor and nonvtumor 
factors were associated with the use of a primary s urgical approach (Table 1 Column 3). Clinical 
N0 stage was associated with a higher likelihood of  a primary surgical approach (N1 vs N0: O.R. 
0.44, C.I. 0.37v0.51, p<0.0001; N2 vs N0: O.R. 0.33 , C.I. 0.28v0.38, p< 0.0001; N3 vs N0: O.R. 
0.26, C.I. 0.20v0.35, p<0.0001).   Younger patients  were more likely to undergo a primary 
surgical approach (age 50v64 vs. <50: O.R. 0.78 C.I . 0.68v0.89, p<0.0001; age 65v79 vs. <50: 
O.R. 0.68 C.I. 0.55v0.83, p<0.0001). Higher volume hospitals were significantly more likely to 
use a primary surgical approach compared to the low est volume hospitals (>50 patients vs 1v10 
pts: O.R. 2.23, C.I. 1.55v3.22, p<0.0001).   In the  multivariable analysis hospital type was not 
associated with primary treatment approach. 
 
Pathologic factors in patients receiving a primary surgical approach 
Of the 5,967 primary surgical patients, 4,833 had c omplete pathologic information regarding T 
stage, N stage, margins, and ECS. In this group, 24 % had positive margins, 25% had ECS, and  
43% had either positive margins and/or ECS. There w as a significant decrease over time in 
positive margin rate (p<0.0001, Figure 3a). Margin positivity was highest in 2007 at 34% and 
dropped to 18% in 2013. Community and low volume ho spitals were more likely to have 
positive margins on final pathology (community 33% positive margin vs. academic 17%, 
p<0.0001; lowest volume 33% vs. highest volume 17%,  p<0.0001, Figure 4). There was no 
change in rates of ECS over time (p=0.271, Figure 3 b). Higher pathologic nodal classification 
was associated with increased rates of ECS (17% of N1, 38% of N2, 51% of N3; p<0.0001, data 
not shown). Page 10 of 26 Cancer

Overall, 56% of patients undergoing a primary surgi cal approach had pathologic N2 or N3 nodal 
classification. Pathologic Nvupstaging occurred in 24% of cN0, 39% of cN1 and 3% of 
cN2a/N2b patients (Table 2a). Pathologic Tvupstagin g occurred in 17% of cT1 and 11% of cT2 
patients. (Table 2b).  
 
Adverse pathologic factors in candidates for single  modality therapy 
Among primary surgical patients with complete patho logic information, 2,570 (53%) were 
clinically T1vT2/N0vN1 and therefore candidates for  single modality therapy with surgery. Of 
these, 723 (28%) were pathologically upstaged out o f single modality therapy, to T3vT4 and/or 
N2vN3. In addition 842 (33%) had positive margins a nd/or ECS. In total, 1,200 (47%) of patients 
originally T1vT2/N0vN1 had at least one adverse fea ture (T3vT4, N2vN3, positive margins, or 
ECS).  
 
DISCUSSION 
The incidence of OPSCC is rapidly increasing in the  United States, due to HPVvassociated 
disease. Many of these patients have low T classifi cation (T1vT2) tumors amenable to primary 
surgical treatment. The potential advantage of this  approach is the possibility of avoiding or dev
escalating postvoperative therapies. To date there has been limited information on trends in the 
primary treatment for patients with early Tvstage O PSCC, or rates of adverse pathologic features 
in surgically treated patients.

 12 We observed a significant increase in the use of pr imary surgery and a decrease in primary 
radiation approach to treating patients with T1vT2 OPSCC between 2004v2013. Although lower 
clinical nodal stage was associated with a primary surgical approach, primary surgery was 
nonetheless chosen for nearly two thirds of patient s with clinically N2/N3 disease. Nonvtumor 
factors including receiving treatment at a high vol ume hospital were also associated with 
selection of a primary surgical approach. 
 
Among the subgroup of patients who had primary surg ery, one in four patients had a positive 
margin. This rate improved over time and there was a lower rate at high volume and academic 
institutions. One in four primary surgical patients  also had ECS. Nearly half (47%) of patients 
treated with primary surgery who by clinical stagin g might have been candidates for surgical 
treatment alone (T1vT2/N0vN1) had at least one adve rse feature requiring adjuvant radiation or 
chemoradiation. 
 
The findings herein have to be considered in the co ntext of important limitations.  First, there 
were a significant number of exclusions due to inco mplete staging information, a basic oncologic 
reporting requirement that should in theory be bett er represented. The strength of the NCDB for 
inquiry into practice patterns in head and neck onc ology might be examined in separate 
dedicated analyses given this large amount of missi ng data. Second, in determining the cohort 
who had primary surgical therapy, we included patie nts coded as having a “tonsillectomy” who 
were listed as a subcategory of “pharyngectomy NOS. ” While we cannot be certain that such 
patients received an oncologic resection, we did ex clude from our primary surgical cohort any 
patient who had a “local tumor excision” or “excisi onal biopsy,” which would help exclude the Page 12 of 26 Cancer

 13 simple tonsillectomies done explicitly for biopsy p urposes. We also note that all patients in this 
study classified as having primary surgical therapy  had both pathologic T and pathologic N 
classification recorded, implying primary tumor res ection and neck dissection; pathologic N 
classification especially would not likely be seen in patients having primary radiation therapy. 
The issue of classification of tonsillectomy as pri mary surgery or not is important since simple 
tonsillectomy confers no benefit to these patients and may lead to overtreatment if there are 
resulting positive margins. Third, HPV status was only routinely recorded in th e NCDB after 
2010 and so was not accounted for in this analysis.  This is important because the relevance of 
ECS and its relationship to Nvupstaging may be diff erent between HPVvrelated and nonvHPVv
related disease. Nonetheless, decisions about prima ry treatment selection over much of the study 
were probably made without information about HPV st atus since it was not routinely tested in 
clinical practice during many of these years. In ad dition, the NCBD does not record information 
on prev or postvoperative radiologic workvup and re voperations for positive margin status, factors 
that may influence treatment decisionvmaking. Final ly, information on pathologic features of 
perineural invasion and lymphovascular invasion are  not available in the NCDB, so there may be 
underestimation of the rates of adverse features am ong surgically treated patients.  
 
The steepest rise in primary surgical therapy has b een observed toward the end of the study 
period, correlating with 2009 FDA approval of TORS as well as increasing interest in other 
methods of transoral endoscopic head and neck surge ry including transoral laser microsurgery 
(TLM). 19  Hospital volume was also predictive of a primary s urgical approach. High volume 
hospitals were the innovators and early adopters of  transoral approaches resulting in a surgical Page 13 of 26 Cancer

An important goal in primary treatment selection, e specially for HPVvrelated OPSCC, is to avoid 
the increased toxicity associated with multimodal a djuvant therapy that would obviate the 
desired goal (devescalation) of surgical therapy.4 In NCCN guidelines over the study period, 
indications for postvoperative adjuvant therapy (ra diation alone or chemoradiation) include 
adverse features of advanced pathologic T stage (T3 /T4), advanced N stage (N2/N3), positive 
margins, ECS, perineural invasion, and lymphovascul ar invasion.15  It should be noted that some 
data suggest that ECS may not be as important in HP Vvrelated OPSCC, 21  and a future 
prospective trial may negate this as a recommendati on for adjuvant chemoradiation. 22  
Nevertheless during the years of this study and as of this publication, positive margins and ECS 
are considered indications for adjuvant chemoradiat ion (triple modality therapy) as a Category 1 
recommendation based on RTOG and EORTC data showing  benefit in these patients.23v25  In 
some patients, primary surgical treatment results i n none of these features, and the patient is 
therefore able to avoid any adjuvant treatment with  radiation or chemoradiation. To the degree 
that any of these pathologic factors might be antic ipated before treatment selection, there may be 
opportunities to improve the treatment selection pr ocess in an attempt to avoid escalated 
modalities of adjuvant therapy. 
 
Positive margin status is a factor that should be a nticipated before choosing primary surgery.  
Although there is some debate about the meaning of close or positive margins in HPVvrelated 
OPSCC, most surgeons nonetheless strive to minimize  this adverse factor. 26  Reported positive Page 14 of 26 Cancer

 15 margin rates in the literature for TORS are as high  as 33%. 27   The decrease in positive margin 
status observed over time may be related to improve ment in patient selection combined with 
advancement in surgical skill as experience increas ed. Consistent with this observation is that 
positive margins were more commonly observed in low  volume hospitals. While continued 
overall progress in technique might be expected, a ceiling effect of technical improvement may 
exist where a rate of positive margins persists. 
 
ECS is another pathologic risk factor that should b e better anticipated before treatment selection. 
In this cohort, one in four patients undergoing pri mary surgery had ECS. One recent study found 
that greater than half of HPVvrelated regional meta stases were found to have ECS and that CT 
was not a reliable method for determining the prese nce of ECS in patients with HPVvrelated 
OPSCC. 24   In the future, ECS may be considered less importa nt for HPVvassociated disease. 21, 22  
Until that time, better ways to predict ECS will le ad to fewer patients selected for primary 
surgical treatment who end up having escalated post voperative therapy.   
 
More than two out of three patients with clinically  advanced nodal disease underwent surgery. 
These patients are more likely to receive escalated  adjuvant therapy secondary to advanced nodal 
disease and the increased probability of having ECS . Importantly however, primary surgical 
patients have pathologically staged nodal informati on, whereas in primary radiation patients, 
only clinical staging is used to determine need for  adjuvant therapy. Pathologic staging may 
sometimes reveal a lack of nodal metastases seen on  prevoperative imaging, leading to less 
unnecessary adjuvant treatment in this group than i f they were treated with primary radiation 
based on imaging staging alone. Conversely, patholo gic staging may lead to important upstaging, Page 15 of 26 Cancer

 16 identifying patients who might otherwise be undertr eated with adjuvant therapies. Specifically, 
patients with advanced nodal disease (e.g. HPV nega tive oropharyngeal cancer) may have 
improved outcomes with primary surgery followed by chemoradiation, but one prospective trial 
attempting to answer this question was recently clo sed due to insufficient accrual.28  
Alternatively, functional outcomes may be superior in patients with advanced nodal stage 
undergoing primary surgery followed by a lower dose  of radiation as compared to standard 
concurrent chemoradiation without compromising onco logic outcomes, a question which is 
currently being examined in an ongoing trial 29 .  Until such data has matured, and with higher 
rates of HPV positive disease, the high volume of p rimary surgery in this cohort theoretically 
requiring escalated adjuvant therapy should be exam ined.  
 
Patients with cT1vT2 and cN0vN1 tumors are potentia l candidates for single modality therapy 
with surgery alone. In this cohort, more than one i n four such patients were T or Nvupstaged 
enough to require adjuvant therapy, one in three ha d positive margins and/or ECS theoretically 
requiring adjuvant chemoradiation, while slightly m ore than half had no adverse features 
requiring adjuvant therapy.  While a full clinical assessment of the submucosal extent of tumors 
involving the base of tongue and tonsil may be diff icult, Tvupstaging in general would suggest 
radiographic evaluation undervrepresented the exten t of tumor at the time of pretreatment 
evaluation. Nvupstaging also suggests nodal disease  that was more advanced than seen on 
pretreatment radiologic imaging.  Improvements in p retreatment radiologic staging could help 
better select patients for primary surgery who do n ot need adjuvant therapy.

 17 Although there is great enthusiasm for the primary surgical approach to treating T1vT2 OPSCC 
because of the possibility of limiting treatment re lated morbidity, we have demonstrated 
elements of suboptimal treatment selection that may  ultimately be leading to escalation of 
adjuvant therapy. The findings shed light on areas where improvement is needed in treatment 
selection and treatment provision.
