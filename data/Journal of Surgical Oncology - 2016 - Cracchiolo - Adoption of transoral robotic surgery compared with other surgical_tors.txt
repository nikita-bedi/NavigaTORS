Background and Objectives: Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) has increased for treatment of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC).
To de ﬁne the adoption of TORS, we analyzed patterns of surgical treatment for OPSCC in the US.
Methods: Cases of T1-T3 OPSCC treated with surgery between 2010 and 2013 from the National Cancer Database were queried.
Results: Of 3,071 patients who underwent primary surgical management for T1-T3 OPSCC, 846 (28%) underwent TORS. On multivariable analysis,
low tumor stage (T2 vs. T1: OR 0.75, CI 0.37 –0.51, P<0.0001; T3 vs. T1: O.R. 0.33, CI 0.28 –0.38, P<0.0001), treatment at an academic cancer
center (O.R. 2.23, C.I. 1.29 –3.88, P¼0.004) and treatment at a high volume hospital (34 –155 cases vs. 1 –4 cases: O.R. 9.07, C.I. 3.19 –25.79,
P<0.0001) were associated with increased TORS approach. Signi ﬁcant geographic variation was observed, with high adoption in the Middle
Atlantic. Positive margin rates were lower when TORS was performed at a high volume versus low volume hospital (8.2% vs. 16.7% respectively,
P¼0.001).
Conclusions: Tumor and non-tumor factors are associated with TORS adoption. This analysis suggests uneven diffusion of this technology in the
treatment of OPSCC.

INTRODUCTION
In the right conditions, new technology will ﬁrst be adopted by
innovators, followed by diffusion into society through cumulative
normal distribution [1,2]. Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) as a
primary surgical treatment modality for oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (OPSSC) is in the early stages of this adoption curve.McLeod and Melder published the ﬁrst clinical report of TORS utilizing
theda Vinci robot (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) for the
excision of a benign vallecular cyst [3]. The modality ’s extension to
malignant tumors came in 2006, when in three patients, O ’Malley,
Weinstein and colleagues showed the ef ﬁcacy of TORS in the treatment
of three patients with carcinoma of the tongue base [4]. Subsequent
reports from a prospective trial at the University of Pennsylvania
demonstrating the safety and feasibility of performing radicaltonsillectomy and partial pharyngectomy led to Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approval of TORS for management of early
stage (T1 and T2) malignant disease in 2009 [4 –7].
Historically, primary surgical approaches to the oropharynx
involved open surgical resection with mandibulotomy. Alternatively,transoral oropharyngectomy with mouth gag and headlight has been
used to reduce the morbidity of open surgery and transoral laser
microsurgery (TLM) has augmented the ability to resect the base of
tongue and tonsils in the hands of some surgeons [8,9]. Nonetheless, the
morbidity associated with open surgery, exposure challenges withtransoral surgery, and studies demonstrating effective nonsurgical
management [10] have resulted in many authors advocating for primary
radiation treatment for OPSCC over the last several decades [11].
In order for new technology to be adopted, advantages over current
strategies need to be demonstrated. Hockstein et al. reported bene ﬁts of
TORS including: 3-dimensional imaging through a dual endoscope
mechanism, enabling visualization at angles and reducing line of site
issues; robotic instrumentation ’s wider range of motions compared to
traditional endoscopic instruments; scaling of movement, allowinglarge movements of the hands that result in small corresponding
instrument movements; and the dampening of hand tremors [6]. In
contrast to TLM, TORS allows for an en bloc rather than a piecemeal or
cutting procedure in addition to overcoming the line of sight limitations.Reported disadvantages of TORS include lack of tactile feedback from
the da Vinci robot ’s EndoWrist Instruments, limited con ﬁguration
options, and cost [12,13]. Despite its disadvantages, TORS represents a
standardized, easily adoptable, and reproducible method of surgical
management of OPSCC. In addition to this new surgical technology,emerging understanding of the epidemiology of human papilloma virus
(HPV)-related OPSCC has improved prognosis and increased rates
of early presentation. These surgically amenable small tumors
(T-classi ﬁcation disease) are well-suited for management transoral
primary surgical treatment [14 –18]. Further, the widespread
acknowledgment of the signi ﬁcant morbidity and late toxicities
associated with primary radiation strategies in a patient population
poised to live for many years have laid the groundwork for a
technology-driven paradigm shift in the treatment of OPSCC [19].
To date, only isolated, early time points have been analyzed
regarding national trends of the adoption and diffusion of TORS

/C2232016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. compared to other primary surgical approaches in the treatment of
OPSCC [20,21]. We recently reported that primary surgical treatment
of early stage OPSCC has risen [22]. It is unclear what contribution
TORS has had in this increase and if this surgical approach has beenuniformly adopted. We hypothesize that adoption of TORS nationally
has increased, however, it is concentrated and associated with tumor
and non-tumor factors. To test this premise, we analyzed the surgicalapproach utilized in a large cohort of patients in the National Cancer
Database who were diagnosed with OPSCC. In addition, we used
margin positivity rates to determine what factors in ﬂuence better
surgical outcomes for those undergoing TORS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
The data source for this study was the National Cancer Database
(NCDB), a joint program of the Commission on Cancer and the
American College of Surgeons that collects hospital-based registry data
on over 80% of US oral cavity and pharynx cases [23]. The source ﬁles
were used in accordance with the NCDB Participant User Files (PUF)data use agreement.
We identi ﬁed all patients /C2118 years diagnosed with clinically
staged T1-T3 OPSCC from 2010 to 2013. We included ICDO codes
for the “oropharynx ”(ICDO C019, C090, C091, C098, C099, C100,
C101, C102, C103, C104, C108, C109, C142) with histologicallyproven squamous cell carcinoma tissue examined by microscope.
Patients who had received treatment outside of the NCDB reporting
facility, whose treatment information was incomplete, and whosestaging information was inconsistent with treatment information or
could not be assessed were excluded. Patients were included in the
analysis only if they underwent a primary surgical procedure, which
we de ﬁne as surgery before any radiation or chemotherapy. Local
tumor excision such as excisional biopsy was not considered primarysurgery. For tonsil and other oropharynx sites, all categories of
pharyngectomy were used. For base-of-tongue tumors, primary
surgical patients were those who underwent at least glossectomy and
not local tumor excision. The total cohort with complete data was
3,071 patients (Fig. 1).
Outcomes
The primary outcome assessed was surgical approach. Patients were
categorized as receiving TORS or other surgical approach. Patientswere de ﬁned as treated with TORS as the primary surgical approach if
they were coded as “Robotic assisted or Robotic converted to open. ”
Other surgical approaches included the codes endoscopic or
laparoscopic; endoscopic or laparoscopic converted to open, open or
approach unspeci ﬁed. The NCDB does not specify what other surgical
approach was used (open, Bovie/headlight, TLM) and so thisinformation could not be included in the analysis. Additionally the
“surgical approach ”item was ﬁrst introduced into the NCDB in 2010,
making that year the starting point of our analysis.
A secondary outcome was the presence of a positive margin
resection in patients who underwent primary surgical treatment. For this
analysis, we included only those records of patients undergoing TORS
or other surgical approach with complete information on margin status.
Covariates
Covariates including patient sociodemographic factors including
age, sex, race, insurance status (grouped as private, Medicare, Medicaidor uninsured), and comorbidities (Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity index)
were analyzed [24]. Hospital volume was de ﬁned as the total new
OPSCC cases treated with a primary surgical approach inclusive of
2010 –2013, with hospitals divided into quartiles by volume for
analysis. Hospital type was de ﬁned as either academic, which included
academic/research programs as well as National Cancer Institute-
designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers, or community, which
included Community Cancer Programs, Comprehensive Community
Cancer Programs, Integrated Network Cancer Programs, and other
speciﬁed types of programs.
Analysis
Chi-squared tests were used to analyze TORS adoption over time
and to compare tumor factors, patient sociodemographic factors, and
hospital factors among patients who underwent TORS versus other
surgical approach. For multivariable analysis we used hierarchical
generalized linear models with a logit link function to account forclustering of patients within hospitals while evaluating the in ﬂuence of
tumor, patient sociodemographic, and hospital factors on the binary
choice of primary surgical approach. Pvalues<0.05 were considered
signiﬁcant. Analyses were conducted using Stata Statistical Software
(Release 12.1; Stata Inc., College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Characteristics of the Cohort
We identi ﬁed 3,071 patients with T1-T3 OPSCC treated with
primary surgery between 2010 and 2013. Males represented 77% of the
study cohort. Table I summarizes the patient and tumor characteristics.
The majority of patients were ages 50 –64 (55%) and white (90.7%). The
Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity score was zero for 78.1% of patients. Mostpatients were treated in an academic center (65.5%), with one quarter of
patients (25.4%) being treated in low volume centers (performing 1 –4
surgical cases over study time) and 24.3% being treated in high volumecenters (treating 34 –155 surgical cases over study time). Patients with
private insurance represent the majority of the cohort (63.3%).
Regarding tumor factors, 44.0% of patients were clinically staged as
T1, 45.6% as T2 and 10.4% as T3.
TORS as Choice of Surgical Approach Over Time
Of the patients with OPSCC with tumor stage T1-T3 disease
treated with primary surgery, 27.6% were treated with TORS as the
primary surgical modality during the study period. TORS utilizationincreased over time (20.6% in 2010 to 32.2% by 2013, P<0.0001;
Fig. 2). When TORS was selected as the surgical approach, 14.2% of
patients had a positive margin resection compared to an overall
positive margin rate of 23.8% in patients treated with other surgical
approach ( P<0.0001; Fig. 3a). Positive margin status during this

 Patient and Tumor Factors Associated With TORS as Choice
of a Primary Surgical Approach
There were no signi ﬁcant differences in selecting TORS versus a
non-robotic modality (hereafter referred to as “alternative ”) based on
age, race, or Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity scores. Males were more
likely to undergo TORS than females (29.2% vs. 21.9%, respectively,
P<0.0001). Clinical tumor classi ﬁcation also in ﬂuenced surgical
modality section; patients with T3 tumors were more likely to undergo
an alternative surgical treatment than T2 or T1 tumors (19.1% T3,27.9% T2, 29.2% T1; P¼0.001). On multivariate analysis, male sex
(female vs. male: OR 0.74, CI 0.58 –0.95, P¼0.018) and lowerT classi ﬁcation (T2 vs. T1: OR 0.75, CI 0.37 –0.51, P<0.0001; T3 vs.
T1: O.R. 0.33, CI 0.28 –0.38, P<0.0001) were associated with
increased likelihood of undergoing TORS versus another primary
surgical approach.
Early Adoption of TORS Across Insurance Status, Hospital
Setting, and Geography

 status was associated with selection of TORS as the surgical treatment
approach for OPSCC on univariate analysis. Patients with Medicare
were most likely to have TORS (31.6%), while private insurance,
Medicaid and uninsured patients were less likely (28.5% private
insurance, 26.8% Medicaid, and 16.4% uninsured, P¼0.021).
The percentage of total surgical cases done across the 4 quartiles of
hospital volume centers were similar (1 –4 cases, 25.4%; 5 –15 cases,
27.2%; 16 –32 cases, 23.1%; 33 –155 case; 24.3%; Fig. 4a). On
multivariate analysis, patients receiving treatment in an academic center
were signi ﬁcantly more likely to have TORS than patients undergoing
treatment in a community hospital (O.R. 2.23, C.I. 1.29 –3.88,
P¼0.004; Fig. 4b). Additionally, the highest-volume hospitals were
signiﬁcantly more likely to use TORS compared to the lowest-volume
hospitals (34 –155 cases vs. 1 –4 cases: O.R. 9.07, C.I. 3.19 –25.79,
P<0.0001; see Fig. 4a). TORS carried out in low-volume hospitals
were more likely to have a positive margin resection than cases in high-
volume hospitals (16.7% vs. 8.2%, P¼0.001; Fig. 4a). Community
hospitals were also associated with a signi ﬁcantly higher rate of a
positive margin resections than academic centers (26.9% vs. 11.6%,
P<0.0001; see Fig. 4b).
Geographic variability was observed in the early adoption period
analyzed. The highest rates of TORS were seen in the Middle Atlantic(NJ, NY, PA) region and the lowest in Northeast (CT, MA, ME, NH,
RI, VT; Fig. 5a). In the Middle Atlantic, TORS ’utilization
approached half of cases (42.6%). By contrast, a signi ﬁcant
majority of patients (84.8%) in the Northeast were treated with analternative surgical approach. On multivariate analysis, treatment
location was associated with use of TORS, most notably observed
with the comparison of the Atlantic versus the Southeast (DC, DE,FL, GA, MD, NC, SC, VA, WV; Atlantic vs. Southeast: OR 5.66, CI
2.55 –12.58, P<0.0001). Figure 5b illustrates the distribution of
TORS cases by geographic region.
DISCUSSION
As hypothesized, adoption of TORS nationally is concentrated in
speciﬁc geographic locations, academic hospitals and in high volume
centers. These ﬁndings allow for analysis of these patterns and have
important hypothesis-generating implications for further study oftechnologic adoption in the ﬁeld of surgery.
Diffusion of a novel surgical device into clinical practice depends on
economic, institutional, and psychological factors. In addition, adoption
relies on the technology ’s proven value when compared to past strategies.
Rogers described the Diffusion of Innovations Theory to explain theprocess of how new technology spreads through society. Rogers and
others have described three variables that in ﬂuence the rate of
dissemination: (i) how the novel technology is perceived; (ii) thecharacteristics of people who adopt the innovation; and (iii) the
environment into which the technology is being adopted [2,25]. To date,
only data from isolated and early time points have been analyzed
regarding the national adoption of TORS and the factors associated with
the technique ’s diffusion. Chen et al. demonstrated both increased
utilization of TORS in academic centers as well as an increase in
utilization over two early time points [21]. In the present study we used
the NCDB to assess these trends over a longer time period and analyze the
adoption patterns in the context of the Diffusion of Innovations Theory.
Since FDA approval in 2009, use of TORS as a tool for the primary
surgical treatment of OPSCC has risen. In 2010, 22% patients
undergoing primary surgical treatment for T1-T3 OPSCC were
treated with TORS. A modest rise to 28% of cases was observed by
2013. Classically, an adoption curve of new technology takes on an
S-shaped normal curve when plotted on a cumulative basis over time.This represents a slow early phase, followed by a more rapid middle
phase after a “tipping point, ”andﬁnally a plateau with variable market
share penetrance. The current study suggests that TORS for the
treatment of T1-3 OPSCC is in the early stages of this adoption curve.
While we cannot know the extent to which TORS adoption willcontinue to follow this classic adoption pattern including how steep the

 linear phase of the curve will be and what degree of market penetration
will be achieved at its plateau, this early view of national diffusion
patterns enables us to craft a hypothesis on its anticipated course and
potential barriers to adoption (Fig. 6).
In line with the Rogers ’theory, the head and neck surgical
community ’s perception of the procedure ’s value will be a key driver in
the adoption TORS for the treatment of OPSSC. De ﬁning value as the
ratio of bene ﬁt over cost, TORS must be proven oncologically sound
and technically superior at an equal or reduced cost. The stated goals of
primary surgical treatment for OPSCC are a potential increase in the
therapeutic index by reducing morbidity via an attenuation of toxicity ofadjuvant therapy. Margin status represents an important variable in
reducing indications for adjuvant therapy as well as optimizing
oncologic results. In the current study, 14% of patients who underwent
TORS had a positive margin resection. This rate did not signi ﬁcantly
change over time. When comparing positive margin rates in patientshaving TORS versus other surgical approaches, a lower positive margin
resection rate in the TORS group would suggest ef ﬁcacy and thereforeshould drive adoption, assuming other factors associated with the
technology have perceived bene ﬁt. In addition, the lack of signi ﬁcant
change in positive margin incidence suggests that surgeons learning the
TORS procedure are subject to an acceptable learning curve, which
could further hasten adoption. Alternatively, the low positive margin
status could result from increased use of TORS in T1 and T2 tumors(for which it is FDA approved) compared to T3 tumors. Intuitively,
surgeons would be more apt to use new technology in the treatment of
smaller, less-risky primary tumors.
Cost represents the denominator in the value equation required for
adoption of new technology. Cost analysis of TORS has beenextensively reported [26 –28]. In an analysis of how TORS compared
to traditional open surgery in overall hospital costs, Richmon et al.
showed an overall median reduction of $4,285 per patient in the 1.2% of
patients who underwent TORS [28]. This study only takes into account
the acute costs of TORS, with most of the cost bene ﬁts of this approach
associated with the signi ﬁcantly decreased length of hospitalization
compared to open procedures. Importantly, others have shown that the

 cost bene ﬁts of TORS are diminished when adjuvant therapy is required
post-operatively [26,27]. These ﬁndings call into question the cost
beneﬁts of TORS for a broad group of patients with T1-T2 OPSCC,
potentially slowing adoption.
Characteristics of early adopters often set the pace for adoption and
diffusion of new technology. Adopters can be described as a bellcurve [2]. On the early tail of the curve are the innovators, followed by the
early adopters, early majority, late majority, and ﬁnally laggards making
up the late alternative tail. The current data shows TORS utilizationconcentrated in the Middle Atlantic states. These ﬁndings are consistent
with the presence of early adopters in institutions in this region, including
the sites of initial TORS studies. The current data would suggest skewed
adoption with concentrated use among a small group of early adopters.
Early adopters ’perception of TORS may differ from surgeons practicing
in the in the community, leading to concentrated areas of acceptance. In
the present analysis, patients who underwent TORS in an academic
setting were more than half as likely to have a positive margin resection
(12%) as patients who had TORS in the community (27%). This
signiﬁcant difference was also observed in low versus high volume
settings (17% vs. 8% positive margin resection rate, respectively). It
could be hypothesized that early adopters represented in academic and
high volume centers perceive bene ﬁt based on their outcomes while those
in low volume centers question the procedure ’s value owing to these
inferior outcomes. Strati ﬁed opinion of the technology based on personal
experience could result in concentrated areas of adoption with slow
diffusion, as observed in the present study.
The environment into which the technology is being adopted
also in ﬂuences the adoption curve. Rates of surgical treatment of
OPSCC are rising [22]. This is secondary to shifts in the understanding
of epidemiology and biology of HPV-related OPSCC as well as
acknowledgment of the signi ﬁcant morbidly and late toxicities
associated with primary radiation treatment [19]. It has beenobserved that patients with HPV-related OPSCC present with early T
classi ﬁcation disease. [16,17]. This shift in presentation signi ﬁcantly
strengthens the argument for surgical treatment of this disease.
Additionally, the earlier age of presentation and improved survival
observed in HPV-related OPSCC has highlighted the morbidity risksassociated with adjuvant treatment and prompted clinical trials
examining the role of transoral approaches as part of a de-escalation
strategy [14,29]. Certainly, the current environment in the treatment of
OPSCC promotes technologic advancement and diffusion. Findings ofongoing clinical trials as well as enhanced understanding of the biology
of HPV-related disease will undoubtedly in ﬂuence adoption and
diffusion patterns of TORS in the future.
This study ’sﬁndings must be considered in the context of important
limitations. First, the NCDB started recording use of TORS in 2010, one
year after FDA approval. We are therefore unable to assess the earliest
adoption period of this technology. Additionally, because this is a new
code in the NCDB database, coding bias is possible. Delay in accuratecoding of this new procedure may result in undercounting of TORS
cases. Also, strict inclusion criteria resulted in a signi ﬁcant number of
patients deleted secondary to treatment outside of an NCDB facility or
incomplete staging. Although the stringent criteria for inclusion results
in less patients included, this allows for appreciation of more robustresults. Finally, case coverage for oropharynx in the NCDB is estimated
to be 70%, with some geographic variation in case coverage related to
the proportion of hospitals in a state that are accredited by the American
College of Surgeons ’Commission on Cancer [20]. This could lead to
bias when analyzing geographic distribution of TORS.
CONCLUSIONS
While TORS utilization has increased during the short early
adoption period studied, this analysis suggests uneven diffusion the
value of this technology in the treatment of OPSCC. Longer time
periods need to be analyzed as the adoption curves mature. Results of
clinical trials using transoral approaches and advances in robotictechnology may shorten the linear phase of the adoption model. While
TORS represents an exciting technologic advancement in the treatment
of OPSCC, rigorous assessment of any new technology is essential and
evidence of value needed in order to justify its adoption. Perception of
this technology, experience of the adaptors as well as the mindset of thehead and neck surgery community will shape the adoption curve in the
following decades.
