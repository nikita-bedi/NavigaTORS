HEAD & NECK SURGERY - GENERAL RISKS:
The surgery and alternatives have been reviewed with the patient, and all questions have been answered. Risks and benefits, as well as potential complications, have been discussed, and include: 
1.	Bleeding: intra-operative bleeding requiring blood transfusion, and transfusion-related infectious diseases, are extremely uncommon.  The risk for post-operative (delayed) hematoma (collection of blood from delayed bleeding) is < 10% in those of average risk, but not zero. 
2.	Wound infection: is rarely encountered, and to prevent this pre-operative antibiotics are ordered for patients at higher risk. Antibiotics are regularly given right before, and occasionally during, the procedure to reduce the chance of infection.
 
TORS (Transoral Robotic Surgery):
I also discussed potential complications and risks as well as the benefits particular to this transoral endoscopic head and neck surgical procedure.   
•	Taste changes / oral injury: injury to the mouth and post-operative dysgeusia (taste changes) are possible, due to the use of oral retractors. Sometime, there is residual tongue numbness or tingling. 
•	Bleeding: The risk of bleeding was also discussed in detail.  Based on longitudinal studies, the risk of serious bleeding is between 5% and 10% and catastrophic bleeding is less than 1%. The greatest risk of bleeding with TORS is between post op day 10-14, and thus it is important to abstain from NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, etc.) or anticoagulation, more commonly known as blood thinners (aspirin, Eliquis, Xarelto, heparin, lovenox, etc) for at least 14 days following surgery.
•	Swallowing dysfunction: there may be short-term or rarely long-term swallowing dysfunction. 
•	Speech impairment:  Speech impairment may be temporary or permanent depending on the site of surgery.  Rehabilitation with the help of a speech and language pathologist improves both speech and swallowing functions.
•	Feeding tube: We also discussed the need for possible nasogastric feeding tube in the short term, for 1-2 weeks, or even a longer term, up to 3-4 weeks.  Speech and swallowing problems are expected and may last for weeks to months.  A feeding tube is placed through the nose to help with nutrition while waiting for reasonable return of swallowing mechanism. 
•	Tracheostomy: As well, the possible role for emergency tracheotomy or preventative tracheostomy was discussed. Rarely, tracheostomy tube placement may be necessary if aspiration or breathing will be an issue.  Rarely do feeding and tracheostomy tubes become permanent.  
 
NECK DISSECTION: 
Two post-operative sequelae are expected following neck dissection: 
3.	Mild spinal accessory nerve dysfunction from manipulation of the nerve for which post-operative rehabilitation will be needed to avoid permanent painful-shoulder-syndrome; this may require physical therapy.  
4.	The marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve will be manipulated to dissect free pre- and post-vascular lymph nodes in level I-b. As such, a temporary but possibly permanent paresis of this nerve is possible.  Facial exercises following the neck dissection are recommended to mitigate against any long-term dysfunction and will coordinate with physical therapy, post-operatively.  Finally, numbness to the surgical area is expected, and occasionally of the earlobe as well.
