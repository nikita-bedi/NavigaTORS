Follow up for mouth and oropharyngeal cancer
After treatment for mouth and oropharyngeal cancer, you have regular check ups at the hospital. You might also have tests including blood tests, x-rays and scans. Over time, these appointments become less frequent.Â
Why you might have follow up appointments
You usually haveÂ follow up appointments to check how you are and see whether you have any problems or worries. The appointments also give you the chance to raise any concerns you have about your progress.
How often are my check ups?
How often you see your specialist depends on:
how you are feeling
the type of treatment you have had. Below is a general guide. Your check ups might be more or less often.Â
In the first 2 years  your check ups are usually every 2 months
In the third to fifth year your check ups are usually every 3 to 6 months
After the fifth year you may have yearly checks
What happens during the appointments?
Your doctor or nurse examines you at each appointment. TheyÂ ask how you are feeling, whether you have had any symptoms or side effects, and if you are worried about anything. You might also have tests at some visits.
Tests mightÂ include:
blood testsÂ
x-rays
a test to look inside your upper air passages (nasoendoscopy)
a CT scan
an MRI scan
an ultrasound scan
a PET-CT scan
Thyroid levelsÂ
Your doctor will regularly check your thyroid levels if you had external radiotherapy to your neck. About 10 to 40 out of 100 people (10 to 40%)Â have low thyroid hormone levels after radiotherapy. This can make you feel very tired a lot of the time. You can have thyroxine supplements to correct the low levels.
Seeing other healthcare professionals
Depending on your individual needs you may see a speech and language therapist or a dietician if you have:
changes to your speech
problems with eating or swallowing
This may be at the hospital, or you may see someone near your home at a local clinic or your GP surgery.
Seeing your dentist
Itâs also very important to have regular dental check ups.Â Your specialist nurse can give you advice on how often you should have a dental check up.
Between appointments
Contact your doctor or specialist nurse if you have any concerns between appointments. You should also contact them if you notice any new symptoms. You donât have to wait until your next visit.
Many people find their check ups quite worrying. A hospital appointment can bring back any anxiety you had about your cancer.
It can help to tell someone close to you how youâre feeling. Sharing your worries can mean they donât seem so overwhelming. Many people find it helpful to have counselling during or after cancer treatment.

Smoking
Your doctor will encourage you to give up smoking before you start treatment. It is still worth giving up smoking after mouth or oropharyngeal cancer as it reduces the risk of your cancer coming back.Â
